### Key Quotes

#### Elder Ulisses Soares
"Personal righteousness is one of the most important qualifications to represent the Savior before the world. It also qualifies us to have the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord with us. ... If you obey with a willing heart, you will be demonstrating to the Lord your willingness to follow Him, your love for Him and for our Heavenly Father."

"Obedience underlies our life decisions and allows God to open the heavens to shower His blessings upon us during our mortal existence and through eternity. Our obedience is a sign of our love, friendship and discipleship to the Savior who we represent as missionaries."

#### Elder Quentin L. Cook
"As you live righteously, you will not only escape bondage from the adversary, but you will also become an example of hope and light to others."
