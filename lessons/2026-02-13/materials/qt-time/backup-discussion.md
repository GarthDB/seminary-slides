# Backup QT Time Discussion
## February 13, 2026

### Use This If Annalisa Didn't Prepare

#### Main Question
"Why do you think obedience is so important when it comes to sharing the gospel with others?"

#### Discussion Points

**1. Personal Experience**
- Have you ever tried to share something you believed in?
- Did your actions match your words?
- How did that affect how people received your message?

**2. The Connection Between Obedience and the Spirit**
- Why do we need the Holy Ghost when sharing the gospel?
- What does the Spirit do that we can't do on our own?
- How does obedience help us have the Spirit?

**3. Being Examples**
- What does it mean to be an example?
- Have you ever been influenced by someone's good example?
- How can our obedience help others want to learn about the gospel?

**4. Missionary Work for Everyone**
- Do you have to be a full-time missionary to do missionary work?
- What are some ways we can share the gospel now, as teenagers?
- How does living the gospel help prepare us for future missions?

#### Follow-Up Questions
- What's one commandment that you find easy to keep? Why?
- What's one commandment that's harder for you? Why?
- How can we help each other be more obedient?
- What blessings have you received from being obedient?

#### Transition to Main Lesson
"These are great insights about obedience. Today we're going to study specifically why obedience is so important when bringing others to Christ, whether as a full-time missionary or as a member missionary. We'll look at scriptures that teach us about obedience and we'll even prepare a short talk outline on this topic."

### Alternative Backup Questions

If the main backup question doesn't generate discussion, try one of these:

**Question 2:**
"What's the difference between obeying because we have to and obeying because we love God?"

**Question 3:**
"Have you ever seen someone's obedience make a difference in their life or someone else's life? What happened?"

**Question 4:**
"If someone asked you, 'Why should I follow all these rules?' what would you say?"

### Time Management
- Keep discussion to 5-8 minutes
- If students are engaged, can extend to 10 minutes but adjust later lesson timing
- Make sure to transition to main lesson by 12:10 at latest
