## February 13, 2026

### Main Question
**"Did you watch the Devotional?"**

### Instructions for Teacher
- Annalisa will lead the discussion about the devotional
- Allow her to share what she learned and ask others about their experience (5-8 minutes total)
- Encourage discussion about key messages or insights from the devotional
- If she forgot or didn't prepare, use the backup question from backup-discussion.md

### Follow-Up Questions (if needed)
- What stood out to you from the devotional?
- How does this relate to what we're studying today?
- What insights did you gain from the devotional?
- How can you apply what you learned?
- What message do you think the speaker wanted us to remember?

### Connection to Today's Lesson
- QT time helps us think about gospel principles personally
- Today's lesson is about obedience in missionary work
- Annalisa's question may connect to obedience, missionary work, or another gospel topic
- Be ready to connect her question to the day's theme if appropriate

### Time Management
- Target: 5-8 minutes for QT time
- Opening prayer: 2 minutes
- Total opening activities: 7-10 minutes
- This leaves 30-33 minutes for the main lesson
