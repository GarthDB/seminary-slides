# QT Time - Annalisa
## February 13, 2026

### Main Question
**"Why did President Oaks choose these 4 areas to focus on in his first message to the youth?"**

### The 4 Areas:
1. **"Strengthen Our Faith in Him"**
2. **"Increase Our Humility"**
3. **"Seek Help from Others"**
4. **"Be Patient"**

### Instructions for Teacher
- Annalisa will lead the discussion about President Oaks' message
- Allow her to share insights and ask others why they think he chose these specific areas (5-8 minutes total)
- Encourage discussion about how these 4 areas connect to each other
- If she forgot or didn't prepare, use the backup question from backup-discussion.md

### Follow-Up Questions (if needed)
- Which of these 4 areas do you think is most important? Why?
- How are these 4 areas connected to each other?
- What stood out to you from his message?
- How can you apply one of these areas this week?
- Why do you think humility and patience were included with faith?
- How does seeking help from others relate to today's lesson on obedience?

### Connection to Today's Lesson
- QT time helps us think about gospel principles personally
- Today's lesson is about obedience in missionary work
- Annalisa's question may connect to obedience, missionary work, or another gospel topic
- Be ready to connect her question to the day's theme if appropriate

### Time Management
- Target: 5-8 minutes for QT time
- Opening prayer: 2 minutes
- Total opening activities: 7-10 minutes
- This leaves 30-33 minutes for the main lesson
