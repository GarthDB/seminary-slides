# The Lighthouse Story

<div class="text-center space-y-4">

## A Choice to Make

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">
Like a ship captain approaching a lighthouse, we all have choices about obedience
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Share the lighthouse story from the lesson
- Battleship captain sees a light ahead and radios: "Adjust your heading 20 degrees"
- Reply: "Negative. Recommend you adjust your course 20 degrees"
- Captain: "This is a battleship. Move now!"
- Reply: "This is a lighthouse. Your choice."
- Point: We can insist on our own course, or choose to obey the Lord

# Why Obedience Matters

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

"Personal righteousness is one of the most important qualifications to represent the Savior before the world. It also qualifies us to have the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord with us."

</div>

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-3">

— Elder Ulisses Soares, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles

</div>

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-center">

<div class="text-base font-semibold">

Without obedience, we cannot have the Spirit. Without the Spirit, we cannot effectively share the gospel.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Elder Soares teaches that personal righteousness qualifies us to represent Christ
- It also qualifies us for the Spirit's companionship
- This applies to all members sharing the gospel, not just full-time missionaries
- If we're not obedient, we won't have the Spirit with us
- The Spirit is essential for missionary work

# Two Types of Standards

<div class="text-center space-y-4">

## God's Commandments & Missionary Standards

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">
Some standards apply to everyone. Others are specific to full-time missionaries.
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- We'll look at both types of standards today
- God's commandments: for all of God's children
- Missionary standards: for full-time missionaries specifically
- Both are important for doing the Lord's work
-->

---
layout: default

# God's Commandments

<div class="space-y-3">

## Standards for All God's Children

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-sm">

These apply to all members of the Church, whether on a mission or not:

</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 text-sm">

<div class="p-3 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

- **Law of Chastity**
- **Word of Wisdom**
- **Sabbath Day Observance**

</div>

<div class="p-3 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

- **Honesty**
- **Tithing**
- **Love and Service**

</div>

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-center mt-3">

These commandments prepare us to share the gospel with power

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These are eternal commandments from God
- They apply to all of us, all the time
- Living these standards qualifies us for the Spirit
- When we're obedient, we can invite others to come unto Christ
- Our example of obedience teaches others
-->

# Missionary Standards

<div class="space-y-2">

## Specific to Full-Time Missionaries

<div class="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-sm">

These focus on physical and spiritual safety:

</div>

<div class="space-y-1.5 text-xs">

<div class="p-2.5 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

**Always stay with your companion** - for safety and spiritual protection

</div>

<div class="p-2.5 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

**Avoid dangerous situations** - no power tools, heavy machinery, tractors, trailers, or truck beds

</div>

<div class="p-2.5 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

**Media restrictions** - avoid TV, movies, video games, and unauthorized videos

</div>

<div class="p-2.5 bg-pink-50 rounded-lg">

**Physical contact** - limit to handshakes with opposite gender

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These standards protect missionaries physically and spiritually
- They help missionaries stay focused on their purpose
- They maintain the dignity of the calling
- Even if we don't understand why, obedience brings blessings
- Some missionaries may feel these don't apply to them - but they do!

# Personal Reflection

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-yellow-50 to-pink-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">

Take a moment to prayerfully consider:

</div>

<div class="text-left space-y-2 text-base">

- Your current efforts to be obedient to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ

- Things you are doing well

- Things you may need to adjust to better show your love to Them

</div>

<div class="text-sm italic text-gray-600 mt-4">

Invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize areas for improvement

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Give students 2 minutes for silent reflection
- This is personal - they don't need to share
- Encourage them to listen to the Spirit
- The goal is personal self-assessment
- This prepares them for the scripture study

<div class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."

</div>

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-center">
