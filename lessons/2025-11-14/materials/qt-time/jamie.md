## Question Around

**Question:** "What did you learn this trimester?"

**Purpose:** This is the last day of class for the trimester, so this is a reflection question to help students think about their growth and learning throughout the semester.

*Each student should share something they learned or felt during this trimester of studying the Doctrine and Covenants.*
