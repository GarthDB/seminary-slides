## Main Lesson Activities

### Option 1: Assess Your Learning
Ask students to type in the meeting chat their guess for how long it took to build the Salt Lake Temple. Or you could use the polling feature of your video conference software (if applicable) to ask the students how long it took.

### Option 2: Doctrine and Covenants 130
Have students prepare to teach in groups. (The breakout room feature could be helpful.) Assign each group an option. If time permits, have the groups teach their lessons.

### Option 3: Doctrine and Covenants 131
Share your screen with the class, and visit the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, and the Topics section of the General Conference page on ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Show students the resources, and discuss what you find and learn about marriage.

### Option 4: Doctrine and Covenants 132:1–2, 34-66
Show students where the Gospel Topics Essays are found on ChurchofJesusChrist.org, and direct them to the essays on plural marriage. You might choose to study some together.

### Option 5: Doctrinal Mastery Practice 9 (Recommended for Today)
You could ask students to watch or read President Nelson's teachings about celestial marriage in the talk "[Celestial Marriage](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage?lang=eng&para=5-7#p5)." To watch, see time codes 0:55 to 2:40. In small groups, students could discuss the question "How does celestial marriage compare with anything else?"
