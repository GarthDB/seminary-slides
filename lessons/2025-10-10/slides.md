- Today we're studying Doctrine and Covenants 111, focusing on "Trusting the Lord When We Don't See the Full Picture"
- Key principle: The Lord's purposes are often different and greater than our own expectations
- Application goal: Help students learn to trust God even when circumstances don't make sense
- Historical context: August 1836, Joseph Smith and others traveled to Salem, Massachusetts seeking treasure to help with Church debts, but the Lord had different plans

# QT Time

<div class="text-center space-y-6">

## This Week's Leader
**Harlie**

## Discussion Question
**"How can I trust in Him better when I don't see the full picture and don't see all the different sides?"**

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Harlie is leading QT Time this week
- Give Harlie time to share their prepared question and answer first
- This question perfectly connects to today's lesson about D&C 111!
- Key points to discuss:
  - Joseph Smith went to Salem expecting one thing (treasure) but God had a different purpose
  - Sometimes we think we know what we need, but God sees the bigger picture
  - Faith means trusting God's wisdom even when we can't see the full plan
- Encourage group participation:
  - "When have you had an experience where things didn't go as planned but turned out better?"
  - "What helps you trust God when life doesn't make sense?"
  - "How do you find peace when you don't understand God's plan?"
- Allow about 10 minutes total for this section

# The Salem Story

<div class="space-y-6">

## August 1836 - Salem, Massachusetts

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

### What They Expected
- 💰 Find hidden treasure
- 💵 Pay Church debts
- ⚡ Quick solution to problems
- 🎯 Immediate relief

</div>

<div>

### What God Had in Mind
- 👥 Gather souls
- 🌱 Plant seeds for future work
- 📚 Teach patience and trust
- 🙏 Build faith through trials

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Historical Context - Salem, Massachusetts (August 1836):
- The Church was deeply in debt (about $15,000 - huge amount at that time)
- Jonathan Burgess told Joseph about hidden treasure in Salem from old pirate days
- Joseph, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Oliver Cowdery traveled there
- They searched for treasure but found nothing
- The trip seemed like a complete failure at the time
- BUT - God had a different purpose: to prepare the way for future missionary work

Key Teaching Point:
- We often come to God with specific solutions in mind
- God sees a bigger picture and has better plans
- What looks like failure to us may be success in God's eyes
- The "treasure" God wanted them to find was people's souls, not gold

# God's Perspective vs. Our Perspective

::left::

## Our View
*"Why isn't this working?"*

- We see immediate problems
- We want quick fixes
- We focus on temporal needs
- We measure success our way

**Human Timeline:** NOW

::right::

## God's View
*"I have much treasure in this city"*

- God sees eternal purposes
- He prepares us for greater things
- He values spiritual growth
- His success looks different

**God's Timeline:** ETERNAL

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Key Scripture: [D&C 111:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.2?lang=eng#p2)
"I have much treasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion"

The "treasure" God referred to:
- Not gold or silver
- But souls who would later join the Church
- Seeds planted for future missionary work
- Lessons learned about trusting God's timing

[D&C 111:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.5?lang=eng#p5)
"Concern not yourselves about your debts, for I will give you power to pay them"
- God promises to provide, but in His way and His timing
- He cares about our temporal needs but won't always solve them the way we expect

[D&C 111:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.10?lang=eng#p10)
"Inquire diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants and founders of this city"
- God redirected their focus from treasure hunting to people
- He wanted them to learn the city's history and build relationships
- This prepared the ground for future missionary work in Salem

# The Real Treasure

<div class="text-6xl mb-8">💎</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
What was God's "treasure" in Salem?
</div>

<div class="text-xl space-y-4 max-w-2xl mx-auto">

**"I have much treasure in this city for you"** - [D&C 111:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.2?lang=eng#p2)

<div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg text-lg mt-8">
The treasure wasn't gold—it was <strong>souls</strong> who would later join the Church and missionaries who would serve there.
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
The Real Treasure - What Actually Happened:
- No gold or silver was found on this trip
- The trip seemed like a complete failure
- They returned without money to pay Church debts
- HOWEVER - years later, Elder Erastus Snow was called to serve a mission in Salem
- He baptized over 100 people in that city
- Many faithful members came from Salem
- The foundation had been laid by Joseph's earlier visit

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught about this:
"Sometimes we become so focused on the material blessings we hope to receive that we fail to see the spiritual blessings the Lord wants to give us. The Lord's ways are not our ways. He sees things differently than we do. He knows what we need even better than we know ourselves."

Key Questions for Students:
- When has something that seemed like a failure turned out to be a blessing?
- How does knowing God has a bigger plan help when we face disappointment?
- What "treasure" might God want us to find that we're not looking for?

# Lessons from Salem

<div class="space-y-6">

## What Can We Learn?

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6">

### 1. God's Timing ≠ Our Timing
**[D&C 111:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.5?lang=eng#p5)** - "I will give you power to pay them"
- He will provide, but when He knows is best

### 2. God's Solutions ≠ Our Solutions  
**[D&C 111:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.2?lang=eng#p2)** - Different kind of treasure
- His answers are often better than what we ask for

### 3. "Failures" Can Be Preparation
**[D&C 111:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.11?lang=eng#p11)** - "Be patient in tribulation"
- What looks like a setback may be setup for future success

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Expanding on Each Lesson:

1. God's Timing ≠ Our Timing
   - [D&C 111:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.5?lang=eng#p5): "Concern not yourselves about your debts, for I will give you power to pay them"
   - The debts WERE eventually paid, but not through Salem treasure
   - God's timetable includes preparation time we don't always see
   - Example: Abraham waited 25 years for Isaac
   - Example: Joseph Smith waited years to translate the gold plates
   
2. God's Solutions ≠ Our Solutions
   - They wanted gold; God gave them souls
   - We pray for relief; God gives us growth
   - We want the path cleared; God wants to strengthen us for the journey
   - [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8-9?lang=eng#p8) "My thoughts are not your thoughts"

3. "Failures" Can Be Preparation
   - [D&C 111:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.11?lang=eng#p11): "Be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, and lo, I come quickly"
   - The Salem trip prepared the ground for future missionary work
   - It taught Joseph and others to trust God's bigger picture
   - Sometimes we need to learn lessons before we can receive blessings
   - Faith is built in the waiting

# Application

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

## This Week's Challenge
**Practice the "What If" Prayer**

When something doesn't go as planned this week, pray:
*"What if God has something better in mind?"*

## Personal Reflection
Write in your journal: "Describe a time when something that seemed like a disappointment turned into a blessing. What did you learn about trusting God?"

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
This Week's Challenge: Practice the "What If" Prayer
- When facing disappointment or confusion this week
- Instead of immediately feeling upset or questioning God
- Ask: "What if God has something better in mind?"
- This shifts perspective from frustration to faith
- Helps us stay open to God's purposes
- Reminds us that His plans are often different but always better

Examples to share:
- "What if I didn't make the team because God wants me to develop other talents?"
- "What if this friendship ended to make room for better relationships?"
- "What if this trial is preparing me for something amazing ahead?"

Personal Reflection - Journal Prompt:
"Describe a time when something that seemed like a disappointment turned into a blessing. What did you learn about trusting God?"

Encourage students to:
- Be specific about the situation
- Describe how they felt at the time
- Explain how it turned out differently than expected
- Identify what they learned about God's character
- Consider how this experience can help them trust God in current situations

Additional Application Ideas:
- Share one experience with family or friends this week
- Look for evidence of God's hand in unexpected places
- Keep a "blessings in disguise" list
- Memorize [D&C 111:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.5?lang=eng#p5) or [Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6?lang=eng#p5)
