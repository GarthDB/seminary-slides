# The Time Is Now

<div class="space-y-8">

## President Nelson's Message

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

"My purpose tonight is to make sure that your eyes are wide open to the truth that this life really **is** the time when you get to decide what kind of life **you** want to live forever."

</div>

## Key Scriptures

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8">

<div>

### [Alma 12:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)
"To prepare to meet God"

</div>

<div>

### [Alma 34:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)
"This life is the time"

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Emphasize that NOW is the time to prepare
- Mortality is when we make the choices that determine our eternal trajectory
- The adversary doesn't want us to think about tomorrow or eternal life
-->

# The Promise of Righteous Choices

<div class="space-y-8">

## Eternal Dividends

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

Every righteous choice you make now will pay huge dividends eternally. If you make covenants with God and are faithful, you have the promise of "glory added upon [your head] for ever and ever" ([Abraham 3:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)).

</div>

## Remember

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

### Choices Matter Now
Righteous choices bring immediate blessings and peace

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### Choices Matter Eternally
Covenant choices bring "unimaginable dividends" in eternity

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Every righteous choice matters - both now and eternally
- Covenants are the key to receiving eternal blessings
- "Unimaginable dividends" - we can't fully comprehend the eternal rewards
- Contrast with adversary who doesn't want us thinking about the future

# Three Fundamental Truths

<div class="space-y-8 mt-12">

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 text-left">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

## 1. Know Who You Are

Your true identity shapes every decision

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

## 2. Know What God Offers

They have offered you everything!

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

## 3. Know About Your Conversion

You must own your own testimony

</div>

</div>

<div class="mt-8 text-lg italic text-gray-600">

"You need to understand three fundamental truths that will help you prepare your future course"

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These are the three main sections of President Nelson's talk
- Each truth builds on the previous one
- Together they help us understand our divine potential and purpose
- We'll explore each truth in depth
-->

---
layout: section
---

# Part 1: Know the Truth About Who You Are

<div class="text-center space-y-4">
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">Your true identity shapes every decision you make</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4 italic">"The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make"</p>
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is the first fundamental truth from President Nelson
- Understanding our identity is foundational to making eternal choices
- It's easy to hear "child of God" so often it becomes just a slogan
- But this truth must be imprinted on our hearts
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Who Are You?

<div class="space-y-8">

## Three Essential Identities

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">

### 1. Child of God

You are literally a spirit child of Heavenly Father

[I Am a Child of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/hymns/i-am-a-child-of-god?lang=eng)

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-100 rounded-lg">

### 2. Child of the Covenant

As a member of the Church, you are heir to God's promises

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-100 rounded-lg">

### 3. Disciple of Jesus Christ

You are a follower and student of the Savior

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These three identities are eternal and unchanging
- They define who we truly are in the sight of God
- Ask students: "How does knowing you're a child of God affect your choices?"
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Protecting Your Identity

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

## The Plea

<div class="p-3 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

Do not **replace** these three paramount and unchanging identifiers with any others. No identifier should **displace**, **replace**, or **take priority over** these three enduring designations:

<div class="mt-2 text-center text-base">

**Child of God • Child of the Covenant • Disciple of Jesus Christ**

</div>

</div>

## Why This Matters

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">

<div class="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

### These Identities Are:
- Eternal and unchanging
- Given by God
- Lead to eternal life

</div>

<div class="p-3 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

### Other Labels May:
- Be temporary
- Change over time
- Not lead to salvation

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Other labels and identities may be important, but shouldn't replace these
- Examples of other labels: career, hobbies, nationality, etc.
- The key is compatibility - does this identity support or conflict with your eternal identity?
- These identities have the power to lead us to eternal life
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Other Labels

<div class="space-y-8">

## Understanding Our Identity

<div class="p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

"There are various labels that may be very important to you, of course. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that other designations and identifiers are not significant."

</div>

## The Warning

<div class="p-6 bg-orange-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

Any identifier that is **not compatible** with these three basic designations will ultimately let you down. Other labels will disappoint you in time because they do not have the power to lead you toward eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Other labels aren't bad, but they shouldn't take priority
- Examples of other labels: career, hobbies, nationality, etc.
- The key is compatibility - does this identity support or conflict with your eternal identity?
- Discussion question: "What are some common labels people use today?"
-->

# Your Divine Potential

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-8 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-2xl">

"Make no mistake about it: **Your potential is divine.** With your diligent seeking, God will give you glimpses of who you may become."

</div>

<div class="text-lg text-gray-600 italic">

You can become like your Heavenly Father

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Emphasize: Our potential is divine - we can become like our Heavenly Father
- This is the glorious promise of the gospel
- As we seek diligently, God will show us who we can become
- This potential is only possible through Jesus Christ and His Atonement
-->

---
layout: section
---

# Part 2: Know What God Offers

<div class="text-center space-y-4">
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">Understanding what our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have offered us</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4 italic">"They have offered you everything!"</p>
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is the second fundamental truth
- God's offers are infinite and eternal
- Everything He has, He wants to share with us
- This includes becoming "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17)
-->

---
layout: default
---

# The Father's Plan

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

## Everything!

<div class="p-2 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

In short, They have offered you **everything!**

</div>

## The Plan of Happiness

Heavenly Father's plan for His children allows us to live where and how He lives and ultimately to become more and more like Him. His plan literally makes the richest blessings of all eternity available to us, including the potential for us to become "joint-heirs with Christ" ([Romans 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)).

## God Knows You

<div class="p-2 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, **no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does.** No one will ever be closer to you than He is.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The plan of salvation offers us everything God has
- We can become "joint-heirs with Christ" - inheriting all the Father has
- God knows us individually and perfectly
- He cares about each of us more than anyone else ever could
- We can pour out our hearts to Him in prayer
-->

# The Ultimate Love

<div class="space-y-6">

## The Greatest Gift

<div class="p-6 bg-pink-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

He demonstrated His ultimate love when He sent His Only Begotten Son to die for you—to be your Savior and your Redeemer!

</div>

## What Jesus Christ Offers

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6">

<div>

### Through His Atonement

- He **overcame the world** ([John 16:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/16?lang=eng&id=p33#p33))
- He can **cleanse** us from unrighteousness ([Alma 7:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14))
- He will **deliver** us from excruciating circumstances
- He will **guide, preserve, and protect** us

</div>

<div>

### His Power Available to You

- He will **heal** your broken heart
- He will **comfort** you in your distress ([Luke 4:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng&id=p18#p18); [Alma 7:10–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p10-p12#p10))
- He will give you **access to His power**
- He will make the **impossible** become **possible**

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The Atonement is God's greatest gift to us
- Jesus Christ makes everything possible
- He doesn't just help with spiritual matters - He helps with everything
- Reference: Alma 7:11-12 - He knows how to succor us
- Discussion: "How have you felt the power of Jesus Christ in your life?"
-->

# Covenants and Blessings

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

## Special Love for Covenant Keepers

<div class="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

God has a special love for each person who makes a covenant with Him in the waters of baptism. And that divine love deepens as additional covenants are made and faithfully kept.

</div>

## The Reunion

<div class="p-3 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

Then at the end of mortal life, precious is the reunion of each covenant child with our Heavenly Father ([Psalm 116:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/116?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)).

</div>

## The Most Important Cause

<div class="p-3 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

The gathering of Israel on both sides of the veil is **the** most important cause on earth today. You have an essential role in this gathering.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- God's love deepens as we make and keep covenants
- Baptism is the first covenant, but more follow (temple covenants)
- The gathering of Israel includes temple work for the dead
- Most of God's children haven't yet received saving ordinances
- That's why temples are so significant
- Each student has a role in this gathering work
-->

layout: section
---

# Part 3: Know the Truth About Your Conversion

<div class="text-center space-y-4">
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You must own your own conversion</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4 italic">"No one else can do it for you"</p>
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is the third fundamental truth
- Conversion is personal and individual
- Parents, leaders, and friends can't do it for us
- We must each take responsibility for our own testimony
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Take Charge of Your Testimony

<div class="space-y-6">

## Questions to Consider

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

- Do you want to feel **peace** about concerns that presently plague you?
- Do you want to know **Jesus Christ better**?
- Do you want to learn how His **divine power** can heal your wounds and weaknesses?
- Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the **Atonement** working in your life?

</div>

## The Work Required

<div class="mt-6 p-6 bg-orange-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

Seeking to answer these questions will require effort—**much effort**. I plead with you to take charge of your testimony. **Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it** so that it will grow.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These questions get to the heart of why we need a testimony
- A testimony isn't just nice to have - it's essential for peace and joy
- Growing a testimony requires real effort and work
- We can't coast on parents' or leaders' testimonies
- Ask: "What does it mean to 'own' your testimony?"
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Nourishing Your Testimony

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

## Feed It Truth

<div class="p-2 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

Feed it truth. **Don't pollute it** with the false philosophies of unbelieving men and women and then wonder why your testimony is waning.

</div>

## Daily Practices

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-3">

<div class="p-3 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

### Daily Actions

- **Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer**
- **Nourish yourself** in the words of ancient and modern prophets
- **Ask the Lord** to teach you how to hear Him better

</div>

<div class="p-3 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### Regular Practices

- **Spend more time in the temple** and in family history work
- Make your testimony your **highest priority**
- **Watch for miracles** to happen in your life

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- A testimony needs to be fed with truth from reliable sources
- False philosophies can poison our testimony
- Daily scripture study and prayer are essential
- Temple and family history work strengthen testimony
- When we prioritize our testimony, miracles happen
- Discussion: "What are you currently doing to strengthen your testimony?"
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Seeking Answers

<div class="space-y-2 text-sm">

## Questions Are Good

<div class="p-2 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

If you have questions—and **I hope you do**—seek answers with the **fervent desire to believe.** Learn all you can about the gospel and be sure to turn to **truth-filled sources** for guidance.

</div>

## The Dispensation of Fullness

<div class="p-2 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

We live in the dispensation when "nothing shall be withheld" ([D&C 121:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)). Thus, in time, the Lord will answer all our questions.

</div>

## The Promise

<div class="p-2 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

Immerse yourself in the rich reservoir of revelation we have at our fingertips. I promise that doing so will **strengthen your testimony**, even if some of your questions are not yet answered. Your sincere questions, asked in faith, will **always** lead to greater faith and more knowledge.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Having questions is normal and even encouraged
- The key is seeking answers with faith, not doubt
- Use truth-filled sources (scriptures, prophets, Church materials)
- Not all questions will be answered immediately
- But studying will strengthen testimony even while waiting
- Questions asked in faith lead to more faith and knowledge
- This is the dispensation of the fullness of times
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Your Role in the Gathering

<div class="space-y-2 text-sm">

## A Better Cause

<div class="p-2 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

As you take charge of your testimony and cause it to grow, you will become a more potent instrument in the hands of the Lord. You will be "inspired by a better cause" ([Alma 43:45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p45#p45))—the cause of Jesus Christ!

</div>

## The Most Important Work

<div class="p-2 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

There is nothing happening on this earth more important than gathering Israel **for Him**.

</div>

## Your Invitation

<div class="p-2 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

Let your Heavenly Father know that you want to help. Ask Him to put you to work in this glorious cause. And then stand back and marvel at what happens when you **let God prevail** in your life.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Strong testimony = powerful instrument for the Lord
- The gathering of Israel is the most important work today
- This includes missionary work, temple work, and ministering
- Each person can ask God to put them to work
- When we let God prevail, amazing things happen
- Discuss: "How can you participate in gathering Israel?"
-->
