## Discussion Guide

### Opening Thought (2 minutes)

President Nelson said: "This life really IS the time when you get to decide what kind of life YOU want to live forever. Now IS your time to prepare to meet God."

Think about this: Every choice you make today has eternal consequences. Not just big choices like who to marry or what career to pursue, but everyday choices too.

## Discussion Points (Choose 2-3 based on time and group engagement)

### 1. Daily Choices That Matter (3 minutes)

**Question:** What are some "small" daily choices that actually have eternal significance?

**Possible answers to draw out:**
- What media we consume (shows, music, social media)
- How we speak to and about others
- Whether we pray and read scriptures daily
- How we spend our time
- How we treat our bodies (Word of Wisdom)
- Whether we're honest in small things
- How we use our agency

**Key Point:** President Nelson taught that "every righteous choice that you make here will pay huge dividends now. But righteous choices in mortality will pay unimaginable dividends eternally."

### 2. Identity Shapes Choices (3 minutes)

**Question:** How does knowing you're a child of God change the choices you make?

**Follow-up questions:**
- Have you ever been in a situation where remembering your identity helped you make the right choice?
- What about being a "disciple of Jesus Christ" - how does that identity guide your decisions?
- President Nelson warned about letting other labels replace our eternal identities. What are some labels or identities that might compete with our true identity?

**Key Point:** "The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make."

### 3. Future-Focused Thinking (3 minutes)

**Question:** When you think about your future - both in this life and eternally - what excites you? What concerns you?

**Discussion prompts:**
- What do you hope your life will look like in 5 years? 10 years? 
- What about eternally - what brings you comfort or hope about eternal life?
- Are there things about your future that worry you or make you uncertain?

**Key Point:** President Nelson promised: "Your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe" - IF we make covenant choices and let God prevail in our lives.

### 4. The Power of Questions (3 minutes)

**Question:** President Nelson said "If you have questions—and I hope you do—seek answers with the fervent desire to believe." What questions do you have about your future or about the gospel?

**Create safe space:**
- It's okay to have questions - the prophet HOPES we have questions
- Questions asked in faith always lead to greater faith and knowledge
- We can share questions without needing to answer them all today
- Where can we turn for truth-filled answers?

**Key Point:** We live in a time when "nothing shall be withheld" (D&C 121:28) - God will answer our questions in His time.

### 5. Taking Charge of Your Testimony (3 minutes)

**Question:** What does it mean to "own" your testimony? Why can't someone else do it for you?

**Discussion prompts:**
- Can you coast on your parents' testimonies? Why or why not?
- What are you personally doing to strengthen your testimony?
- President Nelson said: "Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it."
- What's one specific thing you could do this week to strengthen your testimony?

**Key Point:** Your conversion is your own. No one else can do it for you, but the blessings are worth the effort.

### 6. The Gathering of Israel (2 minutes)

**Question:** President Nelson said gathering Israel is "the most important cause on earth today." How can we, as teenagers/young adults, participate in this work?

**Possible answers:**
- Share the gospel with friends (not just missionaries' job)
- Family history and temple work
- Be an example and light to others
- Invite others to come unto Christ
- Strengthen fellow Church members
- Prepare for missions

**Key Point:** "Let your Heavenly Father know that you want to help. Ask Him to put you to work in this glorious cause."

## Closing Thought (1 minute)

President Nelson blessed us to:
- Know the truth about who we are
- Treasure our divine potential  
- Take charge of our own testimonies
- Have the desire and strength to keep our covenants

He promised that when we do these things:
- We will experience spiritual growth
- We will have freedom from fear
- We will have confidence beyond imagination
- Our future will be more exhilarating than we can presently believe

**Final Question:** What is ONE choice you will make today or this week because of what you've discussed?

## Alternative/Additional Questions

If the discussion needs redirecting or additional depth:

1. **"What does it mean that 'righteous choices in mortality will pay unimaginable dividends eternally'? Can you think of an example?"**

2. **"President Nelson said God has offered us 'everything!' What does that mean to you?"**

3. **"How can remembering Jesus Christ's Atonement help us make better daily choices?"**

4. **"What's the difference between a label that's compatible with being a child of God versus one that isn't?"**

5. **"If you could ask President Nelson one question about your future, what would it be?"**

## Tips for Leading This Discussion

1. **Start with personal experience** - Share a brief example from your own life if helpful
2. **Create safety** - Make it okay to share honestly and to say "I don't know"
3. **Listen more than talk** - Let students process and share their thoughts
4. **Connect to the lesson** - Tie discussion back to what they'll learn in the main lesson
5. **End with action** - Help them commit to one specific thing they'll do
6. **Keep it conversational** - This isn't a lecture, it's a discussion among equals

## If Time Runs Short

Use just the main question and one or two follow-ups:
- "What choices are you making today that will affect your eternal future?"
- "How does knowing your true identity (child of God) change the choices you make?"
- "What's one specific choice you'll make this week to prepare for your future?"

---

## Scripture Connections

If you want to incorporate a scripture reading:

- **[Alma 34:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)** - "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God"
- **[Abraham 3:25-26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p25-p26#p25)** - We came to earth to be proven, and if faithful, glory will be added upon us forever
- **[2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)** - "Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life...or captivity and death"
