### Source Material

**Speaker:** President Russell M. Nelson  
**Event:** Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults  
**Date:** May 15, 2022

### Lesson Overview

President Nelson's message focuses on three fundamental truths that help us prepare for our future on earth and eternal life with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

### Three Fundamental Truths

#### 1. Know the Truth About Who You Are

**Three Essential Identities:**
- **Child of God**: You are literally a spirit child of Heavenly Father
- **Child of the Covenant**: As a member of the Church, you are heir to God's promises
- **Disciple of Jesus Christ**: You are a follower and student of the Savior

**Key Quote:**
> "Tonight, I plead with you not to replace these three paramount and unchanging identifiers with any others, because doing so could stymie your progress or pigeonhole you in a stereotype that could potentially thwart your eternal progression."

**Important Principle:**
No identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations. Any identifier that is not compatible with these three basic designations will ultimately let you down.

**Promise:**
> "Make no mistake about it: Your potential is divine. With your diligent seeking, God will give you glimpses of who you may become."

#### 2. Know the Truth About What God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, Have Offered You

**The Offer:** Everything!

**Key Points:**
- Heavenly Father's plan allows us to live where and how He lives
- We can become more and more like Him
- We can become "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17)
- God knows all and sees all - no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does
- He demonstrated His ultimate love by sending His Only Begotten Son to die for us

**Through the Atonement, Jesus Christ:**
- Overcame the world
- Can cleanse us from all unrighteousness
- Will deliver us from excruciating circumstances
- Will guide, preserve, and protect us
- Will heal our broken hearts and comfort us in our distress
- Will give us access to His power
- Will make the impossible in our lives become possible

**About Covenants:**
God has a special love for each person who makes a covenant with Him in the waters of baptism. That divine love deepens as additional covenants are made and faithfully kept.

**The Gathering of Israel:**
The gathering of Israel on both sides of the veil is THE most important cause on earth today. Each of us has an essential role in this gathering.

#### 3. Know the Truth Related to Your Conversion

**Core Message:** You must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you.

**Questions to Consider:**
- Do you want to feel peace about concerns that presently plague you?
- Do you want to know Jesus Christ better?
- Do you want to learn how His divine power can heal your wounds and weaknesses?
- Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement working in your life?

**The Work Required:**
> "I plead with you to take charge of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it so that it will grow. Feed it truth. Don't pollute it with the false philosophies of unbelieving men and women and then wonder why your testimony is waning."

**How to Strengthen Your Testimony:**
- Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer
- Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets
- Ask the Lord to teach you how to hear Him better
- Spend more time in the temple and in family history work
- Make your testimony your highest priority

**About Questions:**
> "If you have questions—and I hope you do—seek answers with the fervent desire to believe. Learn all you can about the gospel and be sure to turn to truth-filled sources for guidance."

We live in the dispensation when "nothing shall be withheld" (D&C 121:28). Thus, in time, the Lord will answer all our questions.

**Promise:**
Your sincere questions, asked in faith, will ALWAYS lead to greater faith and more knowledge.

**Your Role:**
As you take charge of your testimony and cause it to grow, you will become a more potent instrument in the hands of the Lord. You will be "inspired by a better cause" (Alma 43:45)—the cause of Jesus Christ!

### The Prophet's Blessing

President Nelson blesses us:
- To know the truth about who you are
- To treasure the truth about your glorious potential
- To take charge of your own testimony
- To have the desire and strength to keep your covenants

### Promises

As you live these principles:
- You will experience spiritual growth
- You will have freedom from fear
- You will have confidence you can scarcely imagine now
- You will have strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity
- Your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe
