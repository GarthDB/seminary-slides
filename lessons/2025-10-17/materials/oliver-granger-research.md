## Four Seminary Themes Emphasized

### 1. Sacrifice Over Success
**Principle:** God values our faithful effort more than measurable results

**Application to Oliver:**
- He didn't fully resolve all financial problems in Kirtland
- Some debts remained, some property wasn't recovered
- Yet the Lord said "his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase" (D&C 117:13)

**Source:** Seminary curriculum emphasis on D&C 117

### 2. Stewardship and Responsibility
**Principle:** Temporal and spiritual matters are intertwined in Church service

**Application to Oliver:**
- Given responsibility for temporal/financial matters
- Shows that spiritual service includes practical, worldly tasks
- Being a good steward means managing what the Lord entrusts to us
- Money, time, talents, resources all require faithful stewardship

**Connection to Tithing:** Tithing is about stewardship - acknowledging God owns everything

**Source:** General Handbook teaching on stewardship principles

### 3. Overcoming Adversity / Limitations
**Principle:** Faithfulness is not contingent on perfect capability

**Application to Oliver:**
- Partially blind from 1827 onward
- Travel, reading documents, and business dealings extremely difficult
- Also faced personal financial challenges
- Yet he accepted the call and did his best

**Modern Application:** Our limitations don't disqualify us from serving

**Source:** Church History Biographical Database notes on his blindness

### 4. Eternal Remembrance / Divine Recognition
**Principle:** God does not forget righteous acts, even when they're not widely known

**Application to Oliver:**
- D&C 117:12 - "his name shall be had in sacred remembrance...forever and ever"
- While Oliver isn't well-known today, the Lord remembers him
- God keeps perfect records of our service and sacrifices
- We serve for an audience of One - the Lord
- Human recognition is temporary; divine recognition is eternal

**Modern Application:** Serve faithfully even when no one else notices

**Source:** D&C 117:12-15

## Connection to Tithing Lesson

### Parallel Principles

| Oliver's Example | Our Tithing |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Gave faithfully despite challenges | Give faithfully despite financial concerns |
| Trusted the Lord's promises | Trust the Lord's promises about blessings |
| Prioritized obedience over outcomes | Prioritize obedience over financial fears |
| Received eternal recognition | Receive eternal blessings |

### Why This Introduction Works

1. **Same Historical Period:** Both D&C 117 (Oliver) and D&C 119 (tithing) were received in July 1838 during times of financial hardship

2. **Same Principles:** Both teach about sacrifice, stewardship, faith, and trusting God's promises

3. **Relatable Application:** Oliver's story makes abstract principles concrete before applying them to tithing

4. **Builds Faith:** Seeing how God honored Oliver's faithful sacrifice builds confidence to pay tithing

## Teaching Tips

**Discussion Questions:**
- "How do you think Oliver felt when called to serve despite his blindness?"
- "What does it mean that sacrifice is more sacred than increase?"
- "When have you tried something hard, even when success wasn't guaranteed?"
- "How does Oliver's story help us understand tithing?"

**Key Quote to Remember:**
"His sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase" (D&C 117:13)

This teaches that the Lord values our faithful efforts more than our achievements—a principle that applies perfectly to paying tithing.
