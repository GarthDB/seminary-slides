In His counsel to the Saints, the Savior reveals truths related to His law of tithing. This lesson can help you feel an increased desire to live the Savior's law of tithing.

## Historical Context

By July 1838, the Church was under enormous financial strain. Still, Church members had been instructed to relocate to northern Missouri and build a temple in Far West (see Doctrine and Covenants 115:8–12). The Prophet Joseph Smith met with other Church leaders to consider how to be obedient to the Lord's commands. In response to their prayerful petition, the Savior provided counsel about the law of tithing.

**Read Doctrine and Covenants 119:1–4, looking for what the Savior taught.**

The Lord's expectation for paying tithing has been clarified in our day: "Tithing is the donation of one-tenth of one's income to God's Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 119:3–4; interest is understood to mean income). All members who have income should pay tithing" (General Handbook, 34.3.1).

**Ponder reasons why the Lord asks us to pay tithing.**

## Questions and Answers

Explore one or more of the following common questions:

### What if I prefer to donate 10 percent of my income to other charitable causes?

Elder Robert D. Hales (1932–2017) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles related the following story:

> When a friend of President George Albert Smith asked him what he thought of his friend's personal plan to take what would have been tithing and donate his tenth in charitable donations of his own choice, President Smith's counsel was:
>
> "I think you are a very generous man with someone else's property. …
>
> "… You have told me what you have done with the Lord's money but you have not told me that you have given anyone a penny of your own. He is the best partner you have in the world. He gives you everything you have, even the air you breathe. He has said you should take one-tenth of what comes to you and give it to the Church as directed by the Lord. You haven't done that; you have taken your best partner's money, and have given it away."

### Why is it important to pay tithing even if I don't earn a lot of money?

Elder Lynn G. Robbins, emeritus General Authority Seventy, made clear:

> No bishop, no missionary should ever hesitate or lack the faith to teach the law of tithing to the poor. The sentiment of "They can't afford to" needs to be replaced with "They can't afford not to."
>
> One of the first things a bishop must do to help the needy is ask them to pay their tithing. Like the widow [of Zarephath], if a destitute family is faced with the decision of paying their tithing or eating, they should pay their tithing. The bishop can help them with their food and other basic needs until they become self-reliant. …
>
> When serving a meal, it is much easier to set one more plate at the beginning of the meal than it is to find food for a latecomer once the meal is over and the food has been served. Likewise, isn't it actually easier to give the Lord the firstlings or the firstfruits than it is to hope that there are sufficient "leftovers" for Him? As the founder of our feast, shouldn't He be the guest of honor, the first to be served?
