2. **Stewardship and Responsibility** - Temporal and spiritual matters are intertwined in faithful service
3. **Overcoming Adversity** - Faithfulness is not contingent on perfect capability
4. **Eternal Remembrance** - God does not forget righteous acts, even when they're not widely known

### From the Law of Tithing
1. **What is Tithing?** - One-tenth of our income given to the Lord's Church
2. **Why Tithing?** - To develop faith, acknowledge God as our provider, and receive blessings
3. **Who Pays Tithing?** - All members who have income, regardless of amount
4. **Faith First** - Paying tithing shows we put the Lord first in our lives
