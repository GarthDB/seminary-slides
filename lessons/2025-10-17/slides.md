# Oliver Granger's Divine Assignment

<div class="space-y-6">

## The Challenge

By 1838, the Saints had been driven from Kirtland, Ohio. The Church faced enormous financial debts and unresolved property matters.

**Joseph Smith needed someone he could trust completely.**

## The Calling

Oliver Granger was assigned to return to Kirtland to settle the First Presidency's financial affairs—a difficult and likely impossible task.

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

**[Read Doctrine and Covenants 117:12-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117.12-15?lang=eng)**

Focus on verse 13: *"His sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase"*

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Historical Context and Sources:
- Timeline: D&C 117 was received in July 1838 in Far West, Missouri
- Kirtland situation: The Saints had been forced to leave Kirtland in early 1838 due to apostasy and mob violence
- Financial challenges: The Church had significant debts related to the Kirtland Temple and the Kirtland Safety Society
- Property issues: Land, homes, and the temple needed to be managed or sold
- Source: "Doctrine and Covenants 117," Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (2017), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

Oliver's Assignment:
- "Contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency" (D&C 117:13)
- This meant working to settle debts and property claims so the First Presidency wouldn't be legally vulnerable
- Extremely difficult task: creditors were hostile, many Church members had apostatized, legal climate was unfavorable
- Oliver knew he likely wouldn't fully succeed, but he went anyway

Key Verse Analysis - D&C 117:13:
- "His sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase"
- "Sacrifice" = his faithful effort and dedication
- "Increase" = measurable results or success
- The Lord values our faithful efforts more than our achievements
- This is radical: God cares more about our heart and effort than our results

Discussion Questions:
- "How do you think Oliver felt receiving this assignment?"
- "What does it mean that sacrifice is more sacred than increase?"
- "When have you tried something hard, even when success wasn't guaranteed?"

# The Lord's Promise to Oliver

::left::

## [Doctrine and Covenants 117:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117.12?lang=eng)

<div class="text-lg italic">

"Behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in **sacred remembrance** from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord."

</div>

::right::

## What God Values

<div class="space-y-4">

✓ **Faithfulness** over results  
✓ **Effort** over achievement  
✓ **Sacrifice** over success  
✓ **Obedience** over outcomes

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-sm">

Not all righteous acts are widely known, but God does not forget them.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
The Promise of Eternal Remembrance:
- D&C 117:12 contains one of the most beautiful promises in scripture
- "Sacred remembrance" - not just remembered, but held sacred
- "From generation to generation, forever and ever" - eternal significance
- Source: Doctrine and Covenants 117:12

The Paradox:
- Most Church members today don't know who Oliver Granger was
- Yet the Lord promised his name would be remembered "forever"
- The Lord's remembrance matters more than human fame
- God keeps perfect records of our faithful service

What This Teaches Us:
1. Success ≠ Faithfulness
   - Oliver's mission to Kirtland had limited temporal success
   - Many debts remained unsettled
   - But the Lord counted his effort as "more sacred" than results

2. God Sees All Our Efforts
   - Hidden acts of service
   - Sacrifices no one else knows about
   - Faithful attempts that don't work out
   - Obedience when it's hard

3. Eternal Perspective
   - Mortal success is temporary
   - Divine recognition is eternal
   - The Lord's "Well done" matters most

Application Questions:
- "When have you served faithfully without recognition?"
- "How does knowing God remembers your efforts change your perspective?"
- "What does 'sacred remembrance' mean to you?"

# Four Themes from Oliver Granger's Life

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-12 text-left">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

## 1. Sacrifice Over Success

Granger's work is remembered not for complete success, but for faithful effort—even when imperfect.

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

## 2. Stewardship & Responsibility

He was entrusted with temporal matters on behalf of Church leadership. Spiritual and temporal matters are intertwined.

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

## 3. Overcoming Adversity

Despite personal challenges (health, blindness), Granger obeyed. Faithfulness is not contingent on perfect capability.

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

## 4. Eternal Remembrance

The revelation promises his name would be remembered. God does not forget righteous acts.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
These four themes are emphasized in seminary curriculum when teaching about Oliver Granger. Let's explore each:

Theme 1: Sacrifice Over Success
- Oliver didn't fully resolve all the financial problems in Kirtland
- Some debts remained, some property wasn't recovered
- But D&C 117:13 says "his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase"
- The Lord valued his faithful effort more than the measurable results
- Application: Our worth isn't determined by outcomes but by our faithfulness
- Source: Seminary curriculum emphasis on D&C 117

Theme 2: Stewardship and Responsibility
- Oliver was given responsibility for temporal/financial matters
- This shows that spiritual service includes practical, worldly tasks
- Being a good steward means managing what the Lord entrusts to us
- Money, time, talents, resources - all require faithful stewardship
- Connection to tithing: Tithing is about stewardship - acknowledging God owns everything
- Source: General Handbook teaching on stewardship principles

Theme 3: Overcoming Adversity / Limitations
- Oliver was partially blind from 1827 onward
- This made travel, reading documents, and business dealings extremely difficult
- He also faced financial challenges in his own life
- Yet he accepted the call and did his best
- The Lord doesn't require perfection, just our sincere effort
- Application: Our limitations don't disqualify us from serving
- Source: Church History Biographical Database notes on his blindness

Theme 4: Eternal Remembrance / Divine Recognition
- D&C 117:12 - "his name shall be had in sacred remembrance...forever and ever"
- While Oliver isn't well-known today, the Lord remembers him
- God keeps perfect records of our service and sacrifices
- We serve for an audience of One - the Lord
- Human recognition is temporary; divine recognition is eternal
- Application: Serve faithfully even when no one else notices
- Source: D&C 117:12-15

Discussion Questions:
- "Which of these themes resonates most with you? Why?"
- "How do you see these themes applying to your own life?"
- "What does it mean that God values our sacrifice more than our success?"

Transition to Tithing:
- "These same themes apply to the law of tithing"
- "Sacrifice over success - giving even when it's hard"
- "Stewardship - managing God's resources faithfully"
- "Overcoming adversity - paying tithing despite financial challenges"
- "Eternal remembrance - God sees and blesses our faithfulness"

# Connecting to Today's Lesson

<div class="space-y-8">

## From Oliver Granger to Tithing

Oliver Granger's story teaches us about **sacrifice, stewardship, and faith**—the same principles underlying the law of tithing.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-8">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

### Oliver's Example
- Gave faithfully despite challenges
- Trusted the Lord's promises
- Prioritized obedience over outcomes
- Received eternal recognition

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### Our Tithing
- Give faithfully despite challenges
- Trust the Lord's promises
- Prioritize obedience over financial fears
- Receive eternal blessings

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Making the Connection Clear:
This transition slide helps students see why we started with Oliver Granger before discussing tithing. The principles are parallel:

Parallel 1: Sacrifice and Faith
- Oliver sacrificed time, health, and energy for an unlikely mission
- Tithing requires sacrificing 10% of our income as an act of faith
- Both require trusting God when outcomes are uncertain
- Both show that we value the Lord's work

Parallel 2: Stewardship
- Oliver was entrusted with managing Church property and finances
- We are entrusted with our income and resources
- Both show that everything ultimately belongs to the Lord
- Both require accountability and faithful management
- Tithing acknowledges that the Lord is the source of all we have

Parallel 3: Overcoming Challenges
- Oliver served despite blindness and financial difficulties
- Saints are called to pay tithing even when finances are tight
- Elder Lynn G. Robbins: "They can't afford not to"
- The Lord provides when we're faithful, even in hard circumstances
- Faith precedes the miracle

Parallel 4: Eternal Promises
- Oliver was promised eternal remembrance (D&C 117:12)
- Tithe payers are promised blessings (Malachi 3:10, D&C 64:23)
- Both involve trusting God's word over our own understanding
- Both result in blessings that extend beyond mortal life
- The Lord keeps His promises

Teaching Approach:
- Use this slide to explicitly connect the two parts of the lesson
- Ask: "How does Oliver's story help us understand tithing?"
- Emphasize that both are about faith, not just actions
- Both demonstrate that we trust God more than material circumstances

Key Principle:
The Lord values our faithful sacrifice—whether it's Oliver's mission to Kirtland or our payment of tithing—more than perfect outcomes or financial abundance.

Transition Statement:
"Just as the Lord trusted Oliver Granger with an important stewardship, He trusts us with the stewardship of our income. Let's now study what the Lord has taught about tithing."

# Historical Context

<div class="space-y-6">

## Summer 1838: Financial Struggles

By July 1838, the Church was under enormous financial strain. Church members had been instructed to relocate to northern Missouri and build a temple in Far West.

## A Prophet's Petition

The Prophet Joseph Smith met with other Church leaders to consider how to be obedient to the Lord's commands. In response to their prayerful petition, the Savior provided counsel about the law of tithing.

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

**[Read Doctrine and Covenants 119:1–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119.1-4?lang=eng#p1)**

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The Saints were facing significant financial challenges
- Yet they were still commanded to build a temple
- Joseph Smith sought the Lord's guidance on how to proceed
- The Lord's answer was the law of tithing - a way for everyone to participate
- This shows the Lord's wisdom in providing solutions to real challenges
-->

# What is Tithing?

::left::

## The Lord's Definition

**[D&C 119:3-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119.3-4?lang=eng#p3)**

"One-tenth of all their interest annually"

### In Our Day

"Tithing is the donation of one-tenth of one's income to God's Church"
- *General Handbook, 34.3.1*

::right::

## Key Points

- **10%** of your income
- Given to **the Lord's Church**
- A **standing law forever**
- For **all members** who have income

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### Question to Ponder
Why does the Lord ask us to pay tithing?

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- "Interest" in D&C means income in modern terms
- This applies to everyone who has income - young and old
- It's not just about the money - it's about faith and obedience
- The Lord could provide for His Church in any way, so why tithing?
- It's an opportunity for us to show our commitment and be blessed

# Common Concerns About Tithing

<div class="space-y-4 text-left max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg">

**"I don't earn much money - should I still pay tithing?"**

**"What if I prefer to donate to other charitable causes?"**

**"Can I afford to pay tithing when I have other financial needs?"**

**"Why does the Lord need my money?"**

</div>

<div class="mt-8 italic text-gray-600">
As we study, look for teachings that can help address these concerns.
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These are real concerns people have - they're worth discussing honestly
- The lesson material provides inspired answers to these questions
- Encourage students to think about their own concerns or questions
- We'll address these through prophetic counsel and real examples
-->

---
layout: default

# Teaching Scenario

<div class="space-y-6">

## Imagine This...

The missionaries in your area are teaching one of your friends and you're invited to participate. In the lesson that day, the missionaries introduce your friend to the law of tithing.

After the lesson, your friend mentions to you that he has concerns about paying tithing.

<div class="mt-8 p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

### Reflection Question
What concerns might your friend have? What would you say to help them understand?

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This makes the lesson personal and practical
- Students might be in this exact situation someday
- It's important to understand tithing well enough to explain it to others
- The best way to teach is from our own testimony and experience
-->

---
layout: two-cols
---

# Addressing Concerns

::left::

## "I Prefer Other Charities"

President George Albert Smith's friend planned to donate his tenth to charities of his own choice.

President Smith's response:

"You are a very generous man with someone else's property...

You have told me what you have done with the Lord's money but you have not told me that you have given anyone a penny of your own."

*- Quoted by Elder Robert D. Hales*

::right::

## Key Principle

**The Lord is our partner**
- He gives us everything
- Even the air we breathe
- He asks for only 10%
- The rest is ours to manage

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-sm">

Tithing isn't about what we give to God - it's about what we give back to Him from what He's already given us.

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is a powerful teaching moment
- Everything we have is ultimately from the Lord
- Tithing acknowledges His role as our provider
- It's not "our money" that we're giving - it's His money we're returning
- The other 90% is what He's given us to use
- This perspective shift is crucial to understanding tithing
-->

# The Widow's Example

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## Elder Lynn G. Robbins' Teaching

"No bishop, no missionary should ever hesitate or lack the faith to teach the law of tithing to the poor."

**"They can't afford not to."**

### The Widow of Zarephath Principle

If a family must choose between paying tithing or eating, they should:
1. Pay their tithing
2. The bishop can help with food
3. Until they become self-reliant

</div>

<div>

## Why This Matters

### It's About Priorities

Like setting a plate at the beginning of a meal vs. finding leftovers after.

**The Lord should be:**
- The guest of honor
- The first to be served
- Given the firstfruits
- Not the leftovers

<div class="mt-6 p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

Tithing first = Faith first

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is a challenging but important teaching
- The poor need the blessings of tithing most
- It's about spiritual blessings, not just temporal ones
- Reference 1 Kings 17:8-16 - the widow of Zarephath
- She gave her last meal to the prophet and was blessed
- Faith precedes the miracle
- The Lord will provide when we put Him first
-->

# Video: Blessings of Tithing

<div class="text-center space-y-6">

## Elder Valeri V. Cordón

Watch or read his experience about the blessings of tithing

<div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">

### As You Watch, Consider:

**How have you seen the Lord bless you or others for obeying His law of tithing?**

</div>

<div class="mt-6 text-sm italic text-gray-600">

From the talk "The Language of the Gospel"

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is a great time to share a video if you have access
- If not, you can share the story yourself or have students read it
- Personal experiences are powerful testimonies
- Encourage students to share their own experiences or those of family members
- The blessings of tithing are real and tangible
- Some blessings are spiritual, some are temporal
- All blessings strengthen our faith

Presenter Notes:
Key Takeaways - Bringing Both Parts Together:

1. Oliver Granger - God values our faithful sacrifice more than our success (D&C 117:13)
   - The Lord cares more about our heart and effort than our results
   - Faithful service is remembered eternally, even if not widely known
   - We don't need to be perfect to serve the Lord
   - Our limitations don't disqualify us from faithfulness
   
2. Stewardship - Temporal and spiritual responsibilities are intertwined
   - Oliver managed Church finances; we manage our own
   - Everything ultimately belongs to the Lord
   - Faithful stewardship includes how we use our money
   - Tithing acknowledges God as the source of all we have
   
3. Tithing - One-tenth of our income given as a standing law (D&C 119:4)
   - Clear, simple definition
   - Applies to all members who have income
   - It's permanent, not temporary - part of our covenant path
   - The Lord asks for tithing to bless us, not because He needs our money
   
4. Faith - We trust the Lord's promises and put Him first
   - Both Oliver's service and our tithing require faith
   - Faith precedes the miracle
   - The Lord provides when we're faithful
   - Temporal and spiritual blessings await

Connecting the Two Parts:
- Oliver gave faithful service despite uncertainty → We give faithful tithing despite financial concerns
- Oliver trusted the Lord's promises → We trust the Lord's promises about tithing blessings
- Oliver's sacrifice was "more sacred" than his success → Our faithful tithing is valued over the amount

Next Week: Continue studying the Doctrine and Covenants

Closing Scriptures: 
- D&C 117:13 - Emphasizes that sacrifice is more sacred than success
- D&C 119:4 - Emphasizes that tithing is an eternal law
