<div class="italic">

"What has Jesus Christ done for each of us? He has done everything that is essential for our journey through mortality toward the destiny outlined in the plan of our Heavenly Father. … His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is the central figure."

## President Dieter F. Uchtdorf

"This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God"

</div>

## Elder Gary E. Stevenson

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-base">

"As a child of God, you came to earth to receive a physical body. With your body, you can choose to faithfully follow Jesus Christ. You can choose to obey God's commandments, receive holy ordinances, and make and keep gospel covenants."

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:

# The Three Parts Work Together

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">

## 🌟 Premortal Life

We chose to come to earth and follow God's plan

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-100 rounded-lg">

## 🌍 Mortal Life

We receive a body, learn and grow, make choices, and follow Jesus

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-100 rounded-lg">

## 👼 Postmortal Life

We are resurrected, judged, and receive our eternal reward

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-orange-50 rounded-lg text-center text-xl font-bold mt-6">
Jesus Christ makes all three parts possible!

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These three parts are connected
- You can't understand one without the others

- Without Christ, none of it works
- This gives our entire existence meaning

# Personal Application

::right::

## This Week

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-sm space-y-3">

### Try This:

- Share the plan with someone

- How will you use this knowledge this week?

<div class="text-sm italic text-gray-600 mt-6">
Write your thoughts in your notebook or journal
