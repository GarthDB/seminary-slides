## Question Around

**Question:** "Why do you think we need a Savior? What does that mean to you personally?"

**Purpose:** This question connects to today's lesson on Moses 6:47-68, where we'll learn about the plan of salvation and why we need Jesus Christ. It helps students reflect on their own understanding of the Savior before we study Enoch's teachings about coming unto Christ.

---

*Each student should share their thoughts about why we need a Savior and what that means in their own life.*
