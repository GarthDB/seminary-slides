# Backup QT Time Question

In case Finnley forgets to prepare a question, here's a backup:

## Backup Question

**"Why do you think we need a Savior? What does that mean to you personally?"**

This can be about:
- Why we need Jesus Christ
- What the Savior has done for you
- How the Savior helps you in your life
- What it means to have a Savior

---

## Alternative Simpler Question

If the group needs something more straightforward:

**"What does Jesus Christ mean to you?"**

This can be about:
- How you feel about the Savior
- What you know about Him
- How He has helped you
- Why you're grateful for Him

The goal is to get students thinking about the Savior and why we need Him before we study Enoch's teachings about the plan of salvation and coming unto Christ.
