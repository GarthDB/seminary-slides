## Key Quotes

### President Russell M. Nelson
> "The pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life of everyone who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life. The doctrine of Christ helps us find and stay on the covenant path. Staying on that narrow but well-defined path will ultimately qualify us to receive all that God has. Nothing could be worth more than all our Father has!" ("Pure Truth, Pure Doctrine, and Pure Revelation," Liahona, Nov. 2021, 6)
