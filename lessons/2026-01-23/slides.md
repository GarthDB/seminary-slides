<div class="text-2xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

**President Jeffrey R. Holland**

"The Fall was an essential part of Heavenly Father's divine plan. Without it no mortal children would have been born to Adam and Eve, and there would have been no human family to experience opposition and growth, moral agency, and the joy of resurrection, redemption, and eternal life."
