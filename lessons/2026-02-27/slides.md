# President Dieter F. Uchtdorf

<div class="grid grid-cols-[1fr,200px] gap-6 items-center">

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-base text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

Think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount—that is the measure of God's love for you.

God does not look on the outward appearance. I believe that He doesn't care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage, if we are handsome or homely, if we are famous or forgotten. Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God's love encompasses us completely.

</div>

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">

# Abraham and Isaac

<div class="text-center space-y-4">

## A Similitude of Jesus Christ

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">

The account of Abraham and Isaac can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated toward us through the Savior's atoning sacrifice.

</div>

</div>

<!--

# [Genesis 22:1–2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22?lang=eng&id=p1-p2)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

God commanded Abraham to offer **his son**, **his only son Isaac**, as a **burnt offering**.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

**Think about:** What questions might Abraham have had?

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This was a severe test of faith
- Isaac was the son of promise—the one through whom the covenant would continue
- Abraham had waited so long for Isaac

# [Genesis 22:3–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22?lang=eng&id=p3-p6)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-xl">

**Look for:** Evidence that this was a **difficult commandment** for Abraham to obey.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

**Note:** "He took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon **Isaac his son**"—Isaac carried the wood, as Christ would carry His cross ([John 19:16–18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/19?lang=eng&id=p16-p18)).

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Abraham rose early—obedience despite the cost
- Three days' journey—time to turn back, but he didn't
- Isaac carried the wood up the mountain

# [Genesis 22:7–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22?lang=eng&id=p7-p9)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

Isaac asked: "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"

Abraham said: **"God will provide himself a lamb."**

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

**Look for:** Ways **Isaac reminds you of Jesus Christ**.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-center text-sm">

Then Abraham **bound Isaac** his son and laid him on the altar.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- "God will provide himself a lamb"—prophetic of the Lamb of God (John 1:29)
- Isaac submitted—like the Savior in Gethsemane
- Bound Isaac / Christ bound to the cross (1 Nephi 11:33)

# [Genesis 22:10–18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22?lang=eng&id=p10-p18)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

The **angel of the Lord** called and said: "Lay not thine hand upon the lad." Abraham saw a **ram** and offered it instead.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

**Record:** What did you learn about **Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ** from this story?

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- God provided a ram—He didn't require Isaac's life
- But Heavenly Father would later give His Only Begotten Son—no substitute
- Abraham's obedience and Isaac's submission are a similitude

Your Heavenly Father loves you—each of you. That love never changes. It is not influenced by your appearance, by your possessions, or by the amount of money you have in your bank account. It is not changed by your talents and abilities. It is simply there. It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God's love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love. It is simply always there.
