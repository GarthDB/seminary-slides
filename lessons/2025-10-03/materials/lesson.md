After the vision of Jesus Christ in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836, "the heavens were again opened" ([Doctrine and Covenants 110:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.11?lang=eng#p11)) to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Three ancient prophets appeared and committed essential priesthood keys to them. This lesson can help you understand how the priesthood keys restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith can bless your life.

After the Savior's appearance in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836 (see [Doctrine and Covenants 110:1–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.1-10?lang=eng#p1)), **the Lord sent heavenly messengers to restore additional priesthood keys to the Prophet Joseph Smith.**

Remember that "priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood on behalf of God's children. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by those who hold priesthood keys" (*General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*, 3.4.1, ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also [Doctrine and Covenants 65:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2?lang=eng#p2)).

## 📚 Study Activities

**Complete two or more** to help you better understand the keys that were restored.

### Study Activity A: Doctrine and Covenants 110:11

Moses restored the keys to the "gathering of Israel" ([Doctrine and Covenants 110:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.11?lang=eng#p11)). The keys of gathering authorize those servants holding this authority to direct the preaching of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth.

**President Russell M. Nelson declared:**

> When we speak of gathering Israel on both sides of the veil, we are referring, of course, to missionary, temple, and family history work. We are also referring to building faith and testimony in the hearts of those with whom we live, work, and serve. (Russell M. Nelson, "[Let God Prevail](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson?lang=eng&para=11#p11)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, Nov. 2020, 92)

**Ponder the following questions:**
- How might you help to build faith and testimony in the hearts of those you associate with each day?
- How has your life or the life of someone you know been influenced by the Lord reaching out to us through missionary work?

### Study Activity B: Doctrine and Covenants 110:12

Elias committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham (see [Doctrine and Covenants 110:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.12?lang=eng#p12)). This includes the restoration of the Abrahamic covenant.

**President Russell M. Nelson explained:**

> The covenant God made with Abraham … contained several promises, including … all nations of the earth would be blessed by his seed. …
> 
> … We have received, as did they of old, the holy priesthood and the everlasting gospel. We have the right to receive the fulness of the gospel, enjoy the blessings of the priesthood, and qualify for God's greatest blessing—that of eternal life. (Russell M. Nelson, "[Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/covenants?lang=eng&para=10,21#p10)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, Nov. 2011, 87–88)

**Ponder the following questions:**
- What are some ways the Lord is blessing individuals, families, and nations through His gospel and His priesthood?
- What blessings from the Lord are you experiencing through His gospel and His priesthood?

### Study Activity C: Doctrine and Covenants 110:13–16

Elijah restored the sealing keys, which include the authority to seal families together in the temple.

**Elder Gary E. Stevenson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained:**

> Sealing keys, restored by the Old Testament prophet Elijah, enable ordinances to take place in holy temples. Ordinances performed in these temples enable individuals and families to return to the presence of our heavenly parents. (Gary E. Stevenson, "[Where Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&para=14#p14)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, May 2016, 31)

**Ponder the following questions:**
- What are some ways the Lord blesses us through temple work and sealings?
- How has the Lord blessed, or how can He bless, you and your family through ordinances of the temple?

**Ponder the following questions:**
- How is the Savior preparing us for His Second Coming through the priesthood keys that Moses, Elias, and Elijah restored?
- Why do you think the earth would "be smitten with a curse" ([Doctrine and Covenants 110:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.15?lang=eng#p15)) at the Lord's coming without the restoration of these priesthood keys?

## ❓ Questions and Answers

### Why was what happened in the Kirtland Temple so significant?

The Savior promised the early Saints tremendous blessings for their labor and sacrifice to construct a temple in Kirtland, Ohio. Those blessings included the keys and powers restored on April 3, 1836.

### What was significant about the prophet Elijah's return on Easter Sunday, April 3, 1836?

In our theology, Easter is associated with the ancient Israelite celebration of Passover. Both observances are rich in symbolism pertaining to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to bring deliverance and salvation to the Lord's covenant people.

A traditional part of the annual Jewish observance of the Passover ceremony pertains to the prophesied coming of Elijah. Typically, during the Passover feast, or Seder, a place is set at the table for Elijah, and at a certain time during the meal, the door is opened for the prophet to enter.

As it happened, April 3 was the second day of the Passover season in 1836. So, remarkably, Elijah the prophet did indeed return during Passover.

"For us, then, the prophesied coming of Elijah is a sacred thread that runs through the Feast of the Passover, the salvation of the human family celebrated at Easter, and the sublime events that occurred in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836."
