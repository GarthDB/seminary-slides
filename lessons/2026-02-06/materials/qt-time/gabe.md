## Question Around

**Question:** "When have you felt the Lord helping you through a hard time or trial?"

**Purpose:** This question connects to today's lesson on Moses 7:53-69, where we'll learn how the King of Zion preserves His people. It helps students reflect on times when God has helped them before we study how He will preserve us in the last days.

*Each student should share a brief experience when they felt the Lord's help during a trial or difficulty.*
