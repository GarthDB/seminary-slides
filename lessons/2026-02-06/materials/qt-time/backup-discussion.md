# Backup QT Time Question

In case Gabe forgets to prepare a question, here's a backup:

## Backup Question

**"When have you felt the Lord helping you through a hard time or trial?"**

This can be about:
- A time when you felt peace during difficulty
- When prayer or scripture study helped you
- When someone acted as God's instrument to help you
- When you felt the Spirit comfort you

---

## Alternative Simpler Question

If the group needs something more straightforward:

**"What helps you feel safe or protected when things are hard?"**

This can be about:
- Family or friends
- Prayer and scripture study
- Church and the gospel
- Knowing that God loves you

The goal is to get students thinking about how the Lord helps us before we study how He preserves His people as the King of Zion.
