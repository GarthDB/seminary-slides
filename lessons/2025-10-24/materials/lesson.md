 Create a note for this lesson in your seminary notebook. As you study, write any questions you have and look for answers.*

While the Prophet Joseph Smith was suffering in Liberty Jail, God taught him that though his suffering was deep and painful, it would help him become more Christlike. This lesson can help you understand that because of Jesus Christ, even difficult experiences can help us progress and become more like Him.

## Study the Scriptures

Ponder what is required for rough rocks to become smooth or polished.

![Rocks](https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/1c/45/1c450ab739376eeb30449c6c19340da7a98ad7db/pebbles.jpeg)

Rocks can become polished by rubbing against and colliding with other rocks or sand over an extended period. This process smooths their edges and reveals their deeper, natural colors.

The Prophet Joseph Smith shared the following about himself: 

>

> 
I am like a huge rough stone rolling down from a high mountain, and the only polishing I get, is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else striking with accelerated force … ; … knocking off a corner here and a corner there; thus, I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty. (Joseph Smith, in History, 1838–1856 [Manuscript History of the Church], volume D-1, [1556](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-d-1-1-august-1842-1-july-1843/199), josephsmithpapers.org) 

During the winter of 1838–39, Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were unjustly imprisoned in Liberty Jail and suffered intense afflictions. As part of an inspired letter to the suffering Saints, Joseph included truths God revealed to him about the suffering he was experiencing. 

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 122:5–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p5-p7#p5), looking for what God wanted Joseph to understand about the trials he had to endure in his life.

 Mark the phrase found in [verse 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p7#p7): "**all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good**."

 Record in your study journal what you think it means that afflictions can give us "experience" and be "for [our] good" ([verse 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)). Include how that phrase helps you see things with an eternal perspective. You might record how that relates to the rough and polished rocks from the beginning of the lesson.

As you study today, think about why our loving Father in Heaven would allow you to pass through painful trials. Ponder how the Savior can help you become more like Him through the afflictions and suffering you may experience in your life.
