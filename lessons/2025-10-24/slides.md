# The Polishing Process

<div class="space-y-6">

## From Rough to Polished

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

### Rough Rocks
- Sharp edges
- Dull appearance
- Unrefined

</div>

<div>

### Polished Rocks
- Smooth surface
- Beautiful colors revealed
- Refined and valuable

</div>

</div>

## What It Takes

Rocks become polished by rubbing against and colliding with other rocks or sand over an extended period. This process smooths their edges and reveals their deeper, natural colors.

# Joseph Smith's Testimony

<div class="space-y-6">

## A Rough Stone Rolling

<div class="text-lg italic p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">

"I am like a huge rough stone rolling down from a high mountain, and the only polishing I get, is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else striking with accelerated force … ; … knocking off a corner here and a corner there; thus, I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty."

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4 not-italic">
- Joseph Smith, History, 1838–1856, volume D-1
</div>

</div>

## Context

During the winter of 1838–39, Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were unjustly imprisoned in Liberty Jail and suffered intense afflictions.

# Scripture Study

<div class="space-y-6">

## Read [Doctrine and Covenants 122:5–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p5-p7#p5)

Look for what God wanted Joseph to understand about the trials he had to endure in his life.

<div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

### Key Phrase to Mark

**"All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good"** - [verse 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

</div>

## Reflection Question

What do you think it means that afflictions can give us "experience" and be "for [our] good"?

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Take time to read D&C 122:5-7 as a class
- Discuss how this phrase helps us see things with an eternal perspective
- Consider how this relates to the rough and polished rocks analogy
