# The Smith Family's Heartbreak

<div class="text-center space-y-4">

## A Devastating Loss

<div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg text-left max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-3">

### 1823: Alvin Smith Dies

Alvin was Joseph's oldest brother and a beloved member of the Smith family.

### The Funeral

A local minister officiated at Alvin's funeral. Because Alvin had not been baptized as a member of the minister's congregation, the clergyman declared that **Alvin could not be saved**.

<div class="text-base italic text-red-700 mt-3">
"[The minister] … intimated very strongly that [Alvin] had gone to hell, for Alvin was not a church member"
</div>

<div class="text-xs text-gray-600">
- Joseph's brother William
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This was devastating to the Smith family
- Imagine being told your beloved brother/son is condemned to hell
- This was common doctrine in the 1820s - very harsh view of salvation
- Joseph carried this pain for years
- He and Emma also lost 4 of their 6 infant children
- These experiences made Joseph deeply concerned about the fate of loved ones

# What Questions Would You Have?

<div class="space-y-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-8 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
If you were Joseph Smith, what questions might you have about your brother Alvin?
</div>

<div class="text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-3">

- Can good people be saved if they weren't baptized?
- What happens to children who die young?
- Is God really going to condemn most people to hell?
- How can a loving God's plan be so exclusive?

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Give students time to think about this
- These questions troubled many people in Joseph's time
- The common Christian view in the 1820s was very harsh
- Most people believed only a tiny fraction would be saved
- The rest would suffer eternal torment
- This didn't align with what Joseph understood about God's love

</div>

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">

<div class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-6 italic">
Alvin had died before the restoration of the gospel and had not been baptized in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</div>

</div>

<!--

# Three Life-Changing Truths

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

## From Doctrine and Covenants 137

<div class="text-left max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-100 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold">
1️⃣ All who would have received the gospel will enter the celestial kingdom
</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-100 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold">
2️⃣ The Lord judges us by our works AND the desires of our hearts
</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-100 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold">
3️⃣ All children who die before accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These are the three main truths we'll study today
- Each one is profound and comforting
- Each one corrects false doctrines from Joseph's time
- Each one shows God's love and mercy
- Let's look at each truth in detail
-->

# Truth #1: All Who Would Have Received the Gospel

## [Doctrine and Covenants 137:7–8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.7-8?lang=eng)

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-lg space-y-4">

> **Verse 7**: "All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who **would have received it** if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be **heirs of the celestial kingdom of God**"

> **Verse 8**: "Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who **would have received it with all their hearts**, shall be **heirs of that kingdom**"

</div>

## Key Principle

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
💡 God knows our hearts. Those who would have accepted the gospel if given the opportunity will be blessed as if they had received it.
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is why Alvin was in the celestial kingdom
- He would have received the gospel if he'd had the chance
- God knows what's in our hearts
- This applies to billions of people throughout history
- People who never heard of Jesus Christ
- People who never had a chance to be baptized
- People who died before the gospel was restored
- God's plan is just and merciful
-->

---
layout: two-cols

# Who Does This Include?

::left::

## People Who Would Have Accepted

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

- 🌍 **Those who never heard the gospel**  
  Billions who lived before Christ or in places without missionaries

- 📜 **Those who died before ordinances were available**  
  Like Alvin Smith - died before baptism was restored

- 💔 **Those who were taught false things about the gospel**  
  Misled by incorrect teachings

- 🚪 **Those who never had a fair opportunity**  
  Due to circumstances beyond their control

</div>

::right::

## Why This Matters

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg space-y-4 text-sm">

### This shows us:

- ✝️ **God is perfectly just**  
  No one is condemned for lack of opportunity

- 💝 **God is perfectly merciful**  
  He sees and knows our hearts

- 🏛️ **Temple work is essential**  
  We perform ordinances for those who would have received them

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Families can be together**  
  Our ancestors can receive all blessings

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is such a merciful doctrine
- Think about all your ancestors who lived before the restoration
- Think about people in countries where the Church isn't established
- God doesn't condemn them for circumstances beyond their control
- This is why temple and family history work is so important
- We perform the ordinances for those who would have received them
- This fulfills God's justice and mercy

<div class="p-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-2xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
"Mercifully, God's great plan of happiness and its eternal blessings can be extended to those who did not have the opportunity to hear the gospel in mortality. Temple ordinances can be done vicariously for them."

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- President Nelson emphasizes the MERCY of this doctrine
- God's plan includes everyone who would have accepted
- Temple work extends these blessings vicariously
- This is why we do baptisms for the dead
- This is why we do sealings for families
- We become saviors on Mount Zion for our ancestors

# Truth #2: Judged by Works AND Desires

## [Doctrine and Covenants 137:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng)

### 💪 Our Works

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### ❤️ Our Desires

<!--

# False Traditions Corrected

<div class="space-y-3">

## What People Believed in Joseph Smith's Day

<div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-3 text-sm">

<div class="p-4 bg-red-100 rounded-lg">

**❌ False Teaching #1:** Only a tiny fraction of humanity would be saved. The vast majority would suffer eternal torment.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-100 rounded-lg">

**❌ False Teaching #2:** If you weren't baptized in the "right" church, you couldn't be saved—even if you never had the opportunity to hear the truth.

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-red-100 rounded-lg">

**❌ False Teaching #3:** Babies and children who died without baptism could not enter heaven.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- These were common Christian doctrines in the 1820s-1830s
- This is what the minister taught at Alvin's funeral
- This is what caused so much pain to the Smith family
- These doctrines made God seem cruel and unjust
- They didn't align with the nature of a loving Heavenly Father
- Doctrine and Covenants 137 corrects all these false teachings

# Elder Quentin L. Cook

<div class="p-8 bg-blue-50 rounded-xl space-y-6">

<div class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

> "At the time Joseph Smith received revelations and organized the Church, the vast majority of churches taught that the Savior's Atonement would NOT bring about the salvation of most of mankind. The common precept was that a few would be saved and the overwhelming majority would be doomed to endless tortures of the most awful and unspeakable intensity."

</div>

<div class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

> "The marvelous doctrine revealed to the Prophet Joseph unveiled to us a plan of salvation that is applicable to **all mankind**, including those who do not hear of Christ in this life, children who die before the age of accountability, and those who have no understanding."

Presenter Notes:
- Elder Cook emphasizes how radical this revelation was
- Most churches taught a very exclusive view of salvation
- Only a few saved, most condemned to eternal torment
- The restored gospel teaches something different
- God's plan is "big enough for all His children"
- This includes everyone who would accept the gospel
