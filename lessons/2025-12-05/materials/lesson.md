In January 1836, while in the unfinished Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith saw a vision of the celestial kingdom. In this vision, which is now Doctrine and Covenants 137, the Savior revealed truths about Heavenly Father's plan. This lesson can help students increase their appreciation for Heavenly Father's plan of salvation.

## Historical Background

### The Smith Family's Loss

In 1823, the sudden death of Alvin, the oldest son, devastated the Smith family. The family asked a local minister to officiate at Alvin's funeral. As Alvin had not been a baptized member of the minister's congregation, the clergyman claimed that Alvin could not be saved. Joseph's brother William later said, "[The minister] … intimated very strongly that [Alvin] had gone to hell, for Alvin was not a church member."

Throughout his life, Joseph experienced even more loss with his wife Emma, as they buried four of their six infant children.

**Reflection Questions:**
- What questions might Joseph Smith and his family have had about the death of their loved ones?
- How would you have felt hearing a minister say your loved one could not be saved?

## Key Truths from Doctrine and Covenants 137

### Truth 1: All Who Would Have Received the Gospel Will Enter the Celestial Kingdom

**Read [Doctrine and Covenants 137:7–8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.7-8?lang=eng)**

> "All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom."

**Related Scriptures:**
- [1 Peter 4:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6?lang=eng)
- [Mosiah 15:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.24?lang=eng)

#### President Russell M. Nelson

> Mercifully, God's great plan of happiness and its eternal blessings can be extended to those who did not have the opportunity to hear the gospel in mortality. Temple ordinances can be done vicariously for them. 
>

## Additional Church Leader Insights

### President Henry B. Eyring

> Only a very small minority of God's children obtain during this life a complete understanding of God's plan, along with access to the priesthood ordinances and covenants that make the Savior's atoning power fully operative in our lives. …
> 
> … Our Heavenly Father is anxious to gather and bless all of His family. While He knows that not all of them will choose to be gathered, His plan gives each of His children the opportunity to accept or reject His invitation. And families are at the heart of this plan.
> 
> (Henry B. Eyring, "[Gathering the Family of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god?lang=eng)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, May 2017, 20–21)

### President Dieter F. Uchtdorf

> Let me tell you that your prayers are heard. Your Father in Heaven knows the desires of your heart. I cannot tell you why one individual's prayers are answered one way while someone else's are answered differently. But this I can tell you: the righteous desires of your hearts will be fulfilled.
> 
> Sometimes it can be difficult to see anything beyond the path immediately before you. We are impatient and do not want to wait for a future fulfillment of our greatest desires. Nevertheless, the brief span of this life is nothing in comparison with eternity. And if only we can hope and exercise faith and joyfully endure to the end—and I say *joyfully* endure to the end—there, in that great heavenly future, we will have the fulfillment of the righteous desires of our hearts and so very much more than we can scarcely comprehend now.
> 
> (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "[The Reflection in the Water](https://broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org)" [Church Educational System fireside for young adults, Nov. 1, 2009])

### Elder Quentin L. Cook

> At the time Joseph Smith received revelations and organized the Church, the vast majority of churches taught that the Savior's Atonement would *not* bring about the salvation of most of mankind. The common precept was that a few would be saved and the overwhelming majority would be doomed to endless tortures of the most awful and unspeakable intensity. The marvelous doctrine revealed to the Prophet Joseph unveiled to us a plan of salvation that is applicable to all mankind, including those who do not hear of Christ in this life, children who die before the age of accountability, and those who have no understanding [see Doctrine and Covenants 29:46–50; 137:7–10].

> (Quentin L. Cook, "[Our Father's Plan—Big Enough for All His Children](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/04/our-fathers-plan-big-enough-for-all-his-children?lang=eng)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, May 2009, 36–37)
