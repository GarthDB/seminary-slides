## Assignment Description


Notwithstanding Their Sins, My Bowels Are Filled with Compassion

 Prepare to study by listening to a hymn or song and saying a prayer.  Create a note for this lesson in your seminary notebook. As you study, write any questions you have and look for answers.
The Saints in Missouri struggled to live righteously as the Lord commanded. Consequently, they forfeited much of the Lord’s power and protection and were driven from their homes by their enemies. Despite this, the Lord assured them of His love and compassion toward them. This lesson is intended to help you feel the Savior’s compassion and mercy for you.

Study the Scriptures
Consider the following scenario:

Grace is a young woman who hasn’t been involved with the Church or gospel for several years. During this time, she has made many choices not in line with the Savior’s teachings. These choices have left her feeling distant from the Church and the youth her age in her ward. Her view of Jesus Christ is that He is a perfect being who doesn’t approve of her choices. She feels more comfortable ignoring religious thoughts or questions in her life. She also feels that she has missed opportunities to learn and develop like other youth her age after being away so long.

Think about how you would respond to Grace.
There can be times in our lives when we feel distant from the Savior and His blessings. This has happened to many people, including the Saints in the early days of the Restoration.
In 1833, the opposition in Missouri became violent as mobs began to use force to remove the Saints from Independence. Saints were unsure whether to stand their ground or to flee as the weather grew colder and tensions increased. The Prophet Joseph Smith was in Kirtland, Ohio, at this time but was being updated on the condition of the Saints. Knowing of their pain and distress, the Prophet prayed to ask Heavenly Father if they could be restored to their homes in Missouri. He received a revelation now known as Doctrine and Covenants 101. (For more information about the Saints’ trials, see Saints, vol. 1, The Standard of Truth, chapter 17.)
Read Doctrine and Covenants 101:1–2, 6–8, looking for why the Lord allowed the Saints to suffer the way they did.

What had caused many Saints to lose favor with God?
How have you seen these things in the world today?

The Savior shared important truths with the Saints to reassure them and encourage them to return to Him.
 Complete one or more of the following activities to find truths that could help you and Grace to feel confidence in the Savior’s love. Make some notes on what you could share with Grace to encourage her to return to the Savior.

Motivated by Christ's character
 Read the following scriptures and statements by Church leaders. Mark phrases that help you understand how the Savior feels about those who have sinned.
Doctrine and Covenants 101: 9; 12–16
Hebrews 4:14–16
Elder Ulisses Soares of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:

Unlike you and me, Christ is capable of clearly seeing all facets of a given situation. Even knowing all our weaknesses as He does, the Savior does not rashly condemn us but continues to work with us compassionately over time. (Ulisses Soares, “The Savior’s Abiding Compassion,” Liahona, Nov. 2021, 15)

 Watch the following video of President Jeffrey R. Holland, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Or read the statement from the talk “Laborers in the Vineyard.”

 Write a text to Grace about Jesus Christ using the guidelines above to help you. Include specific words and phrases from these verses and the statements by Church leaders. To help you, you might consider questions like:

What could be helpful for Grace to understand from what you have learned or felt today?
How can understanding Jesus Christ’s compassion and mercy impact our motivation to repent?
What testimony or experience from your own life could you share with Grace about the Savior’s compassion and mercy?

An eternal perspective
As part of His comfort to the Saints, the Lord shared with them an expanded perspective of Zion. Read the following passages and watch the following video to understand the Lord’s perspective more fully for His faithful children. As you study the scriptures, find truths that help you better understand grace.
Doctrine and Covenants 101:16–19 Regarding the Gathering of Israel
Doctrine and Covenants 101:27–38 Regarding the coming Millennium after the Savior’s Second Coming
 President Russell M. Nelson declared:

 In your study journal, write to Grace. Include specific words and phrases from these verses that you feel might help her. To help you, you might consider questions like the following:

How would the Savior want Grace to feel knowing about what is to come?
How can knowing what is to come change her perspective on her current challenges?

Questions and Answers
Explore one or more of the following common questions:

What are different sources of our suffering?
“Adversity comes from different sources. Trials may come as a consequence of a person’s own pride and disobedience. These trials can be avoided through righteous living. Other trials are simply a natural part of life and may come at times when people are living righteously. For example, people may experience trials in times of sickness or uncertainty or at the deaths of loved ones. Adversity may sometimes come because of others’ poor choices and hurtful words and actions” (Topics and Questions, “Adversity” Gospel Library).

Is it possible that my mistakes are beyond the Savior's ability to rescue me?
 Watch the following video of emeritus Seventy Elder C. Scott Grow. Or read the statement from the talk “The Miracle of the Atonement.”

 In a youth broadcast, Elder Gerrit W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared the following example of a youth who didn’t feel he was worthy of God’s love:

Doctrine and Covenants 101:5. Why does the Lord chasten us?
Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:

Divine chastening has at least three purposes: (1) to persuade us to repent, (2) to refine and sanctify us, and (3) at times to redirect our course in life to what God knows is a better path. (D. Todd Christofferson, “As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 98)

Doctrine and Covenants 101:2. What were some of the Saints' transgressions?
Before the Saints were driven from Jackson County, Missouri, they had received several warnings that they would suffer afflictions if they did not repent. For example, in January 1833, Joseph Smith chastised William W. Phelps and Sidney Gilbert for letters they had written that were critical and negative. Orson Hyde and Hyrum Smith wrote a letter to Church leaders in Missouri warning them about “low, dark, &amp; blind insinuations” that were made about the Prophet Joseph Smith. Because of these transgressions and others, Orson Hyde and Hyrum Smith warned that the Saints in Missouri would face “a scourge &amp; a judgment” (in The Joseph Smith Papers, Documents, Volume 2: July 1831–January 1833, ed. Matthew C. Godfrey and others [2013], 367, 373–74).
