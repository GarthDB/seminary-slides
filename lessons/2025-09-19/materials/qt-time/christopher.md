Christopher, Thank you for sharing today in your assignment! I loved how you notice that our class can grow closer if we open up to each other and discuss things that raise questions! In our opening on Friday at Noon on Zoom we are going to start with QT Time - Questions Together.

On Friday, during our lesson can you bring a question you have been pondering that we can open up to the class to discuss. 

You can use the question you have here: Can we help each other in dissecting or feasting on the blessings that others have in store for them?

Or if there is a different question you have while studying this week.

Thank you! Sister B 🐝
