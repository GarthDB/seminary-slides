Thank you Zachary for sharing your insights this week!

When I was reading your post "If you don't ask for and allow the spirit in your life, you will never be able to have it until you do. without the spirit you will struggle to ever get revelation, its possible but it is much much harder to spot and receive."

It reminded me of how Elder Bednar shares in these three videos how to know and receive Light in our Lives: 

Part 1: The Light of Christ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fycvkAhYz1I
Part 2: Discerning Light https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDEXQ-GTYTs
Part 3: Spirit of Revelation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slTa15a3mp0

Can you watch these videos and share any 💡lightbulb moments you learn or questions you ponder during our opening QT time on Friday? This week Christopher will be our QT time leader.

Thank you,
Sister Jamie B
