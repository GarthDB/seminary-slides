# Introduction

<div class="text-center space-y-6">

## Historical Context

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-8 rounded-lg text-left max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4">

Joseph Smith wrote letters to the Saints about the **doctrine of baptism for the dead**.

He expounded upon biblical prophecies to help the Saints understand the importance of being baptized on behalf of their relatives who had died.

<div class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-700 mt-4">
This lesson can help you find information about your deceased ancestors and prepare you to perform ordinances for them in the temple.
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Joseph was in hiding from Missouri authorities
- He was accused of helping plan an attack on former governor Lilburn W. Boggs
- While hiding in Edward Hunter's home, he had many thoughts about baptisms for the dead
- He wrote letters to teach important doctrine about this ordinance
- Reference: Saints vol. 1, pages 466-77

# Opening Activity

<div class="space-y-6">

## List Your Ancestors

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

**In your study journal:**

1. List as many of your ancestors as you can think of
2. Circle those ancestors who have received baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

</div>

## Self-Assessment

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg mt-6">

**On a scale of 1 to 5** (1 = *not confident*, 5 = *very confident*)

How confident are you in your ability to do family history and temple work for your ancestors?

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Give students 3-5 minutes for this activity
- This helps them personally connect to the lesson
- Don't worry if they don't know many ancestors yet - that's part of what we're learning about today
- The self-assessment establishes a baseline - we'll return to this at the end
- Some students may not know if ancestors were baptized - that's okay!

# Background Context

<div class="text-center space-y-6">

## Joseph Smith's Situation

<div class="text-left max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6">

### The Accusation
Missouri authorities accused Joseph Smith of helping plan an attack on former governor Lilburn W. Boggs.

### The Response
Joseph suspected if he returned to Missouri, he would be killed, so he went into hiding.

### The Revelation
While hiding in Edward Hunter's home, Joseph had many thoughts and feelings about baptisms for the dead.

<div class="text-center mt-6 text-lg italic text-blue-600">
See [Doctrine and Covenants 128:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.1?lang=eng#p1)
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Historical context is important for understanding these revelations
- Joseph was in a dangerous situation but still teaching sacred doctrine
- The persecution didn't stop the work - if anything, it accelerated revelation
- Even in hiding, he was thinking about the welfare of the Saints
- Reference: Saints: The Story of the Church, vol. 1, pages 466-77

# Insights from Church Leaders

::left::

## President Henry B. Eyring

<div class="text-sm space-y-4">

> Many of your ancestors did not receive those ordinances. But in the providence of God, you did...

Key Points:
- God knew you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love
- You have the technology to identify them
- You live when temple access is greater than ever
- God trusts you to accomplish this work

</div>

::right::

## The Blessing

<div class="text-sm p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg space-y-3">

Many youth have discovered that family history and temple work:

- ✨ Deepens testimony of the plan of salvation
- 🕊️ Increases the influence of the Spirit
- 🛡️ Decreases the adversary's influence
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Helps them feel closer to family
- ✝️ Helps them feel closer to Jesus Christ

<div class="text-xs italic mt-4">
"This work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us" - D&C 128:18
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Full quote from Henry B. Eyring, "Gathering the Family of God," May 2017
- Emphasize that this work blesses US as much as our ancestors
- Share a personal experience if you have one about how family history blessed you
- This isn't just about helping dead people - it's about our own spiritual growth
- The adversary doesn't want us doing this work - that's why it's so powerful

# Elder Quentin L. Cook

<div class="space-y-6">

## "Baptism for Your Dead"

<div class="p-8 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

> The doctrine of the family in relation to family history and temple work is clear. The Lord in initial revelatory instructions referred to **"baptism for your dead"** [D&C 127:5; emphasis added]. Our doctrinal obligation is to **our own ancestors**. This is because the celestial organization of heaven is based on **families**.

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
Elder Quentin L. Cook, "Roots and Branches," May 2014
</div>

</div>

## Scripture Activity

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 127:5–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/127.5-6?lang=eng#p5)

**Mark the words** "baptism for your dead" that Elder Cook pointed out.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Emphasize "YOUR dead" - not just anyone's ancestors, but YOUR family
- This makes it personal and creates connection
- The celestial kingdom is organized by families - this is fundamental doctrine
- Our work isn't random - it's focused on our own family lines
- This creates eternal bonds and relationships
- Have students actually mark this phrase in their scriptures

# Reflection Question

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6">
What do you imagine it will be like to meet your deceased ancestors?
</div>

<div class="text-2xl text-gray-600">
How might they react to the temple and family history work you have done?
</div>

</div>

<div class="text-lg text-gray-500 italic">
Take a moment to think about this...
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Give students time to really think about this
- This is a powerful question that creates emotional connection
- Consider sharing your own thoughts first to model vulnerability
- Maybe have 2-3 students share if they're comfortable
- The goal is to help them see ancestors as real people who care about them
- This makes the work personal and meaningful, not just an assignment

# Question 1: Dispensation of the Fulness of Times

<div class="space-y-6">

## Definition

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

**Dispensation:** A period of time when the Lord reveals His doctrines, ordinances, and priesthood.

**The Dispensation of the Fulness of Times:** The current dispensation that began with Joseph Smith.

</div>

## Joseph Smith Taught

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

> "The dispensation of the fullness of times will bring to light the things that have been revealed in all former dispensations; also other things that have not been before revealed. He shall send Elijah, the Prophet, etc., and restore all things in Christ"

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith, pages 510-11
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is THE final dispensation before Christ's Second Coming
- All previous truths are being restored
- New things are also being revealed
- Elijah's mission (turning hearts to fathers) is key to this dispensation
- We live in a unique time in history - everything is coming together
- This makes our work with family history even more significant

# Question 2: Becoming Like Christ

::left::

## The Connection

<div class="space-y-4 text-sm">

When we perform ordinances for our ancestors, we:

- ✝️ Act as saviors on Mount Zion
- 💝 Serve others who cannot help themselves
- 🔗 Create eternal family bonds
- 🎁 Give selflessly
- 👁️ See with an eternal perspective

</div>

::right::

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The Savior's work is all about serving others
- When we do temple work, we serve people who literally cannot do it themselves
- This is pure Christlike service - they can't even thank us personally
- We become "saviors on Mount Zion" - helping save our ancestors
- This work requires faith, sacrifice, and love - all Christlike attributes
- If time permits, watch one of these videos (they're short clips)
