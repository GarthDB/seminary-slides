### Main Question

**"If you could talk to one of your ancestors, who would you like to talk to and what would you like to know?"**

---

## Discussion Guide

### Opening Thought (2 minutes)

Today we're learning about baptism for the dead - ordinances we perform in temples for our ancestors who have passed away. Think about this: your ancestors are real people with hopes, dreams, challenges, and testimonies (or opportunities to gain testimonies). Someday you'll meet them.

---

## Discussion Points (Choose 2-3 based on time and group engagement)

### 1. Connecting with an Ancestor (3 minutes)

**Question:** If you could talk to one of your ancestors, who would you like to talk to and what would you like to know?

**Follow-up questions:**
- Why that particular ancestor? What do you know about them?
- What questions would you ask them about their life?
- What would you want to tell them about your life?
- What do you think they'd want to tell you?
- How might they feel about the temple and family history work you do for them?

**Key Point:** President Henry B. Eyring said, "God knew that you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love and that you would have the technology necessary to identify them. He also knew that He could trust you to accomplish this work."

### 2. Why YOUR Ancestors? (3 minutes)

**Question:** Elder Quentin L. Cook pointed out that the Lord said "baptism for YOUR dead" - not just any dead, but YOUR ancestors. Why do you think that matters?

**Discussion prompts:**
- Why not just do temple work for random people?
- What's special about family connections?
- Have you ever felt connected to an ancestor you never met?
- How does family history work strengthen families?

**Key Point:** "Our doctrinal obligation is to our own ancestors. This is because the celestial organization of heaven is based on families." - Elder Cook

### 3. The Blessings for US (3 minutes)

**Question:** This lesson teaches that "this work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us" (D&C 128:18). How can doing work for dead people help living people?

**Possible benefits to discuss:**
- Deepens testimony of the plan of salvation
- Increases the influence of the Spirit
- Decreases the influence of the adversary
- Helps us feel closer to family
- Helps us feel closer to Jesus Christ
- Gives purpose and meaning
- Develops selfless service

**Key Point:** Many youth have discovered these blessings through family history work. It's not just about helping the dead - it changes us!

### 4. Your Confidence Level (3 minutes)

**Question:** On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you in your ability to do family history and temple work? What would help increase your confidence?

**Discussion prompts:**
- What makes family history seem hard or intimidating?
- What tools or resources do you know about? (FamilySearch, Ordinances Ready, etc.)
- Who could help you get started or learn more?
- What's one small step you could take this week?

**Key Point:** You don't have to be an expert! FamilySearch makes it easy, and there are always people willing to help. Starting small is perfectly fine.

---

### 5. Technology and Temple Access (3 minutes)

**Question:** President Eyring said we live in a time when "access to holy temples would be greater than ever in history" and we have technology to find our ancestors. How is our generation uniquely positioned to do this work?

**Discussion prompts:**
- What technology helps with family history? (FamilySearch app, smartphone cameras, DNA testing, etc.)
- How many temples are there now vs. 50 years ago?
- Why might God have saved certain people to be born now?
- What's your role in this "gathering of Israel"?

**Key Point:** This isn't a coincidence. God knew you'd be born in this time and that He could trust you with this sacred work.

---

### 6. Stories from Your Family (2-3 minutes)

**Question:** Do you know any stories about your ancestors? What have you learned about them?

**Create sharing space:**
- Invite students to share briefly (30 seconds each)
- Stories about sacrifices ancestors made
- Faith stories
- Immigration or pioneer stories
- Funny or interesting facts

**Key Point:** When we learn about our ancestors, they become real to us. They're not just names and dates - they're people with personalities and stories.

---

## Closing Thought (1 minute)

President Eyring promised that "many youth have discovered that giving of their time to do family history research and temple work has deepened their testimony of the plan of salvation. It has increased the influence of the Spirit in their lives and decreased the influence of the adversary."

This work isn't just a nice activity - it's powerful and it will bless your life in ways you can't imagine yet.

**Final Question:** What's one thing you could do this week to participate in family history work?

## Alternative/Additional Questions

If the discussion needs redirecting or additional depth:

1. **"Why do you think Joseph Smith was thinking about baptism for the dead while he was hiding from people who wanted to kill him?"**

2. **"What do you think Doctrine and Covenants 128:18 means when it says 'the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link between the fathers and the children'?"**

3. **"How is doing temple work for someone who has died similar to what Jesus Christ did for us?"**

4. **"What questions do you have about family history or temple work?"**

5. **"If you could go back in time and meet one of your ancestors, who would it be and why?"**

## If Time Runs Short

- "How might they feel about the temple work you do for them?"
- "What's one thing you could do this week to help your ancestors?"
