**Create a note** for this lesson in your seminary notebook. As you study, write any questions you have and look for answers.

Joseph Smith wrote letters to the Saints about the doctrine of baptism for the dead. He expounded upon biblical prophecies to help the Saints understand the importance of being baptized on behalf of their relatives who had died. This lesson can help you find information about your deceased ancestors and prepare you to perform ordinances for them in the temple.

## Study the Scriptures

**Activity:** In your study journal, list as many of your ancestors as you can think of. If you can, circle those ancestors who have received the ordinance of baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is *not confident* and 5 is *very confident*, ponder the following question:

- How confident are you in your ability to do family history and temple work for your ancestors?

### Background Context

Review the following information about what led Joseph Smith to write [Doctrine and Covenants 127–128](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/127?lang=eng).

Missouri authorities accused Joseph Smith of helping plan an attack on former governor Lilburn W. Boggs. Joseph suspected if he returned to Missouri, he would be killed. While hiding in Edward Hunter's home, Joseph had many thoughts and feelings about baptisms for the dead ([see Doctrine and Covenants 128:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.1?lang=eng#p1)). Joseph Smith wrote letters to the Saints to teach them important doctrine about the ordinance of baptism for the dead (see *Saints: The Story of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days*, vol. 1, *The Standard of Truth, 1815–1846* [2018], [466–77](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/saints-v1/38-a-traitor-or-a-true-man?lang=eng)).

### Scripture Study

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 128:15–18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.15-18?lang=eng#p15), looking for what the prophets taught about the doctrine of eternal families and baptism for the dead.

As you read these verses, ponder what each prophet taught about the salvation of our ancestors:

- Joseph Smith—[verses 15, 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.15,18?lang=eng#p15)
- The Apostle Paul—[verses 15–16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.15-16?lang=eng#p15)
- The prophet Malachi—[verse 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.17?lang=eng#p17)

### Church Leader Insights

**Read insights from one or more** of the following Church leaders about your role in family history work.

#### President Henry B. Eyring

> Many of your ancestors did not receive those ordinances. But in the providence of God, you did. And God knew that you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love and that you would have the technology necessary to identify them. He also knew that you would live in a time when access to holy temples, where the ordinances can be performed, would be greater than ever in history. And He knew that He could trust you to accomplish this work in behalf of your ancestors. …
> 
> … Many youth have discovered that giving of their time to do family history research and temple work has deepened their testimony of the plan of salvation. It has increased the influence of the Spirit in their lives and decreased the influence of the adversary. It has helped them feel closer to their families and closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. They have learned that this work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us [see [Doctrine and Covenants 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18?lang=eng#p18)].

#### Elder Quentin L. Cook

> The doctrine of the family in relation to family history and temple work is clear. The Lord in initial revelatory instructions referred to "baptism for your dead" [[Doctrine and Covenants 127:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/127.5?lang=eng#p5); emphasis added]. Our doctrinal obligation is to our own ancestors. This is because the celestial organization of heaven is based on families. 
> 
> (Quentin L. Cook, "[Roots and Branches](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/04/roots-and-branches?lang=eng&para=18#p18)," *Ensign* or *Liahona*, May 2014, 45)

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 127:5–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/127.5-6?lang=eng#p5) and mark the words "baptism for your dead" that Elder Cook pointed out.

**Reflection Question:**
- What do you imagine it will be like to meet your deceased ancestors? How might they react to the temple and family history work you have done?

### Video Study

Watch the following video of President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency. Or read the [statement from the talk "Hearts Bound Together."](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together?lang=eng&para=p29#p29)

**Reflection Question:**
- With what you have learned so far about baptisms for the dead, what are some things you can do to help your ancestors receive this ordinance?

## Questions and Answers

**Explore one or more** of the following common questions:

### Doctrine and Covenants 128:20. What is the "dispensation of the fulness of times"?

A dispensation is a period of time when the Lord reveals His doctrines, ordinances, and priesthood. The current dispensation began with Joseph Smith and is called the dispensation of the fulness of times. The Prophet Joseph Smith (1805–44) taught: "The dispensation of the fullness of times will bring to light the things that have been revealed in all former dispensations; also other things that have not been before revealed. He shall send Elijah, the Prophet, etc., and restore all things in Christ" (*Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith* [2011], [510–11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-44?lang=eng&para=6-13#p6); see also [Doctrine and Covenants 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18?lang=eng#p18)).
