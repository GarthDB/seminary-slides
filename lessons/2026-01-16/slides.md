# God's Commandment to Adam and Eve

## [Genesis 1:27–28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27-28?lang=eng)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Verse 27**: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; **male and female created he them**."

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Verse 28**: "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, **Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth**, and subdue it..."

</div>

</div>

## Key Truth

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
💡 From the very beginning, God commanded Adam and Eve to create families
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is the first commandment given to Adam and Eve
- Before anything else, God commanded them to multiply
- This shows how central family is to God's plan
- "Male and female" - marriage between a man and a woman
- This was part of the Creation itself

# God's Commandment to Care for the Earth

## [Genesis 2:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/2.15?lang=eng)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

"And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden **to dress it and to keep it**."

</div>

</div>

## Key Truth

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
🌍 God gave Adam (and us) the responsibility to care for and protect the earth
</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- God gave Adam stewardship over the earth
- "Dress it" means to cultivate, tend, work with it
- "Keep it" means to guard, protect, preserve it
- This was given BEFORE the Fall - caring for creation is part of God's plan
- We are stewards, not owners - the earth belongs to God
- This responsibility extends to our families and future generations
- Taking care of the earth helps provide for families

# The Creation of Eve

## [Genesis 2:18, 21–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/2.18?lang=eng)

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Verse 18**: "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him **an help meet** for him."

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Verses 21–22**: God created Eve from Adam's rib

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Verse 23**: "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."

# Understanding "Help Meet"

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Footnote 18_b**: "Help meet" means "a helper suited to, worthy of, or corresponding to" Adam

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-pink-50 rounded-lg text-lg">

**Note**: The account of Eve being created from Adam's rib is symbolic and represents the **equal partnership** between husband and wife.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- "Help meet" doesn't mean inferior - it means perfectly suited
- The rib story is symbolic of equality and partnership
- They were meant to work together as one
- Eve was Adam's equal companion and partner
