# QT Time

<div class="text-center space-y-6">

## This Week's Leader
**Madison**

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img src="./materials/qt-time/QT Seminary 2025 Madison.gif" alt="QT Seminary 2025 Madison" class="max-w-md rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
</div>

## Discussion Question
**"How do women and men work together in God's plan? Why might it sometimes feel like there are different roles?"**

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Madison is leading QT Time this week
- Give Madison time to share their prepared question and answer first

Sara's Question (adapted for discussion):
Sara shared: "Growing up, I always thought the church was sexist because it seemed like the church favored boys more than girls. Boys could pass sacrament, be in bishoprics, be presidents. I never saw why they could and I couldn't just because I was born a girl. I thought the church made it seem like the only purpose of being a girl was to bring children into this world and be just an object to the man in power. I'd like to learn more about this and maybe change my perspective."

This connects perfectly to today's lesson! Key points to discuss:
- D&C 107:5 - ALL callings are "appendages" to the priesthood (not just men's callings)
- Sister Oscarson's quote about young women being "essential participants" 
- Both men and women exercise priesthood authority when set apart in callings
- Different roles doesn't mean different worth or importance
- Invite students to share scriptures and insights that help with this question

Encourage group participation:
- "What scriptures help us understand men's and women's roles?"
- "How have you seen women exercise spiritual authority and power?"
- "What does it mean that we're all 'essential participants'?"

Allow about 10 minutes total for this section

# The Vine and Branches

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

<div class="text-6xl">🌿</div>

## *"I am the vine, ye are the branches"*
**[John 15:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)**

<div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg text-lg">
<strong>What happens if a branch disconnects from the vine?</strong>
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Historical Context - March 28, 1835:
- New Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were preparing for missions to the eastern United States
- The Apostles were uncertain about how to serve in their new callings
- The Lord revealed D&C 107 to instruct them about priesthood authority and encourage them

The Vine and Branches Teaching:
- Jesus taught this during the Last Supper ([John 15:1-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1))
- Key question for students: "What happens to the branch if it disconnects from the vine?"
- Answer: It withers and dies - cannot produce fruit
- Application: We need to stay connected to Christ to have spiritual power in our service
- This connects to today's lesson about priesthood authority coming from Christ

# Discussion

<div class="space-y-6 text-left max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg">

**Why does it matter that priesthood power comes from Christ?**

**How do ordinances connect us to the Savior?**

**How can this help you serve better?**

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Discussion Questions (expand on these as needed):

1. Why is it important to understand that all priesthood power comes directly from Jesus Christ?
   - Helps us remember we're serving Him, not ourselves
   - Gives us confidence in our authority when we serve
   - Reminds us to seek His guidance and power

2. How do the "outward ordinances" of the Aaronic Priesthood (like baptism and the sacrament) help connect you to Jesus Christ?
   - Baptism symbolizes rebirth and commitment to follow Christ
   - Sacrament renews our covenants and remembrance of Him
   - These ordinances are physical reminders of spiritual truths

3. What can we learn from comparing Church organizations to "appendages" of the Melchizedek Priesthood?
   - All are connected to the same source of authority
   - Each has a specific function but all work together
   - Young women, Primary, Relief Society all derive authority from Christ

4. How might understanding that every calling is attached to the Savior's authority help you better serve others?
   - Gives confidence to act in your calling
   - Reminds you that you represent Christ
   - Helps you seek His power to bless others

# Activity: Draw the Vine

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

<div class="text-8xl">🌿</div>

## Draw in Your Study Journal
**Vine:** Melchizedek Priesthood  
**Branches:** All Church callings

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Activity Instructions:
Have students draw in their study journals:
- The Vine: The Melchizedek Priesthood (represents Jesus Christ and His authority)
- Main Branch: The Aaronic Priesthood
- Other Branches: Church organizations connected to the priesthood:
  - Relief Society
  - Young Women
  - Primary
  - Sunday School
  - Class presidencies
  - All other callings

Sister Oscarson's Teaching (share this quote):
"Young women of the Church need to see themselves as essential participants in the priesthood-directed work of salvation... You hold callings and are set apart by those holding priesthood keys to function as leaders with power and authority."

Key Point: This applies to all youth serving in the Church! Every calling, whether held by men or women, youth or adults, derives its authority from the priesthood of Jesus Christ.

Give students 3-5 minutes to draw and label their vine and branches.

# Application

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

## This Week's Challenge
**Stay Connected to the Vine**

## Personal Reflection
Write in your journal this week

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
This Week's Challenge: Stay Connected to the Vine
- In your current calling or assignment, consciously seek the Savior's power
- Ask yourself: "How can I draw on Christ's authority to better serve?"
- Remember that you represent His priesthood authority when you serve
- Look for opportunities to bless others through your calling

Personal Reflection - Journal Prompt:
"When has someone else's connection to the Savior as they served been a blessing in your life? How can you be that blessing for others?"

Additional suggestions:
- Encourage students to write about their current callings or ways they serve
- Have them think about how they can better draw on Christ's power
- Doctrinal Mastery: Encourage memorizing D&C 107:8 - the key phrase about priesthood power and authority: "has power and authority... to administer in spiritual things"
