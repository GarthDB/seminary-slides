**Date**: Friday, September 26, 2025  
**Points**: 1.0 (Pass/Fail)

## Lesson Overview

In the spring of 1835, members of the newly formed Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were about to leave on their first missions. This revelation from the Lord provided details to help them and others fulfill their priesthood responsibilities. This lesson can help you understand the importance of drawing upon the power of the Savior and His priesthood authority as you serve in His Church.

## Preparation

🎵 **Prepare to study** by listening to a [hymn or song](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/music) and saying a prayer.  
📝 **Create a note** for this lesson in your seminary notebook. As you study, write any questions you have and look for answers.

## Study the Scriptures

### Activity 1: The Vine and Branches

During the Last Supper, Jesus Christ taught about the importance of staying connected to Him (see [John 15:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1)). In your study journal, draw a simple image of a vine with multiple branches. Read [John 15:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) and label whom the vine and branches represent.

**Consider the following:**
- What happens to the branch if it disconnects from the vine?
- Why is staying connected to the Savior necessary in our efforts to serve in His Church?

Ponder for a moment about your connection to Jesus Christ. As you continue to study, seek inspiration as you consider how that connection can bless you and empower you to bless others through Church callings and ministering assignments.

### Activity 2: Doctrine and Covenants 107

On March 28, 1835, members of the newly formed Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were preparing to serve missions to the eastern United States. Some Apostles were unsure about how to serve in their new callings. The Lord revealed [Doctrine and Covenants 107](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng) to instruct them about the priesthood and encourage them in their assignments.

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 107:1–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p1-p4#p1), looking for what the Lord taught about the priesthood.

Compare the name of the priesthood found in [verse 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) with what President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, taught:

> "Christ is the source of all true priesthood authority and power on earth. It is His work, in which we are privileged to assist." (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, ["The Joy of the Priesthood,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2012/10/the-joy-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) *Ensign or Liahona*, Nov. 2012, 59)

📝 **Record your answer** to why you feel it is important to understand that all priesthood power comes directly from Jesus Christ.

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 107:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p8#p8). Look for spiritual blessings that come from the Lord through His priesthood authority and power.

> **Doctrinal Mastery**: [Doctrine and Covenants 107:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) is a doctrinal mastery passage. Mark this passage in a distinctive way so you can locate it easily. Practice memorizing the reference and key phrase: "The Melchizedek Priesthood … has power and authority … to administer in spiritual things." You could do this by drawing an image in your study journal that can help you remember the scripture reference and key phrase. Share your image with someone else and explain how it will help you remember.

## Study Activities

**Complete one or more** of the following activities as you seek to understand the importance of priesthood authority and power while serving in the Savior's Church.

### Activity A: Appendages to the Priesthood

Refer to the image of the vine and branches. Read [Doctrine and Covenants 107:5, 13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p5,p13-p14#p5) and mark what else the vine and branches could be considered. *NOTE: The priesthood mentioned in verse 5 is the Melchizedek Priesthood.*

Consider also labeling the vine as *The Melchizedek Priesthood* and one of the appendages (or branches) as *The Aaronic Priesthood*.

Add to your image where you believe the following organizations of the Church of Jesus Christ would be—either a vine or a branch:
- The Church of Jesus Christ
- Relief Society
- Sunday School
- Young Women
- Primary

Mark the truth in [verse 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) that **all authorities and offices in the Savior's Church are appendages to the Melchizedek Priesthood**.

President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency shared the following about priesthood authority in Church callings:

> "Ultimately, all keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord Jesus Christ, whose priesthood it is. He is the one who determines what keys are delegated to mortals and how those keys will be used. … Since the scriptures state that 'all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood' ([D&C 107:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority." (Dallin H. Oaks, ["The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/04/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&id=p9,p11#p9) *Ensign* or *Liahona*, May 2014, 50)

📝 **Respond to one** of the following questions in your study journal:
- What can we learn from the Lord's comparison of the Aaronic Priesthood and Church organizations to "appendages" of His Melchizedek Priesthood?
- How might understanding that every calling in the Church is attached to the Savior's authority and power help you better serve those around you?
- What additional objects could you compare the Melchizedek Priesthood to besides plants (vines and branches)?

### Activity B: Experiencing Priesthood Power

Read [Doctrine and Covenants 107:8, 18–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p8,p18-p20#p8), looking for ways the Savior provides power through His priesthood to those who serve in the Church. Mark what you find.

Watch the following video of Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles sharing a story about how a stake president received the Savior's power to help serve a young man. Or read the [statement from the talk "The Tender Mercies of The Lord."](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng&id=p15-p19#p15)

Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson, former Young Women General President, taught how priesthood authority can empower young women in their callings. Look for how her statement can apply to all youth as they serve:

> "Young women of the Church need to see themselves as essential participants in the priesthood-directed work of salvation and not just as onlookers and supporters. You hold callings and are set apart by those holding priesthood keys to function as leaders with power and authority in this work. As you magnify your callings in class presidencies and prepare spiritually, counsel together, reach out to minister to your class members, and teach one another the gospel, you are taking your place in this work and both you and your peers will be blessed." (Bonnie L. Oscarson, ["Rise Up in Strength, Sisters of Zion,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2016/10/rise-up-in-strength-sisters-in-zion?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) *Ensign* or *Liahona*, Nov. 2016, 14)

📝 **Record your answers** to the following in your study journal:
- How do the "outward ordinances" of the Aaronic Priesthood (such as baptism and the sacrament) referred to in [verse 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) help connect you to Jesus Christ?
- When has someone else's connection to the Savior as they served been a blessing in your life?
- What did you learn today about the importance of drawing on the power of the Savior and His priesthood authority as you serve in the Church?

## Questions and Answers

**Explore one or more** of the following common questions:

### Q: Doctrine and Covenants 107:5. How are all Church offices connected to the Melchizedek Priesthood?

President Joseph F. Smith (1838–1918) taught:

> "There is no government in the Church of Jesus Christ separate and apart, above, or outside of the holy Priesthood or its authority. … [Auxiliary organizations] are not outside of, nor above it, nor beyond its reach. They acknowledge the principle of the Priesthood. Wherever they are they always exist with the view of accomplishing some good; some soul's salvation, temporal or spiritual." ([Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-f-smith/chapter-38?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) [2011], 341–42)

The Prophet Joseph Smith (1805–44) explained:
