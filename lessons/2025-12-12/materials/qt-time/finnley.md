## Question Around

**Question:** "Have you ever had to act in faith when you didn't understand everything? What was that like?"

**Purpose:** This question connects to today's lesson on Official Declaration 2, where we'll learn about the Martins family and others who exercised faith during uncertain situations. It helps students reflect on their own experiences with faith before we discuss the historical examples.

*Each student should share a brief experience when they had to trust God or move forward with faith despite not having all the answers.*
