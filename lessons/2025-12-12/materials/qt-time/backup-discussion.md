# Backup QT Time Question

In case Finnley forgets to prepare a question, here's a backup:

## Backup Question

**"What's something you've been confused or uncertain about, but you still chose to have faith?"**

This can be about:
- Gospel questions you've had
- Life decisions you had to make
- Times when you didn't understand why something happened
- Situations where you had to trust God's plan

---

## Alternative Simpler Question

If the group needs something more straightforward:

**"When have you had to trust someone even though you didn't understand everything?"**

This can be about trusting:
- Parents or family
- Church leaders
- God
- Friends

The goal is to get students thinking about faith and trust in uncertain situations before we study how the Martins family and early Saints exercised faith regarding the priesthood restriction.
