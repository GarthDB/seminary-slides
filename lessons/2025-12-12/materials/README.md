## Key Quotes

### Elder Helvécio Martins
> "We had found the truth, and nothing would stop us from living it."

> "I could not contain my emotions. Rudá and I went into our bedroom, knelt down, and prayed. We wept as we thanked our Father in Heaven for an event we had only dreamed about. The day had actually arrived, and in _our_ mortal lives."

### President Spencer W. Kimball
> "Day after day I went alone and with great solemnity and seriousness in the upper rooms of the temple, and there I offered my soul and offered my efforts to go forward with the program. I wanted to do what he wanted."

### President Gordon B. Hinckley
> "There was a hallowed and sanctified atmosphere in the room. For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God... The Spirit of God was there."
