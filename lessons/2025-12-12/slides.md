Rio de Janeiro, 1972
</div>

</div>

# April 1972: A Difficult Choice

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">

**The Situation:**

In April 1972, missionaries visited Helvécio and Rudá Martins in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

**What They Learned:**

- The missionaries taught them the restored gospel
- They gained a testimony of its truthfulness
- They also learned about a Church policy that restricted Black males of African descent from being ordained to the priesthood

**The Challenge:**

Helvécio and Rudá, who were of African descent, had to decide how to respond to this situation.

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The Martins quickly gained a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel
- But they also learned about the priesthood restriction
- This was a real dilemma - they believed the gospel was true, but faced this policy
- Ask students: What questions might you have in this situation?
- What would be some possible ways to respond?
- This sets up the tension they faced
-->

# What Would You Do?

<div class="space-y-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-8 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-4">
If you were in their situation, what questions might you have?
</div>

<div class="text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-2">

Pause and think...

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Give students 30 seconds to think
- Possible questions: Why does this policy exist? Is this fair? Can I really join this church?
- Don't dwell too long here - just get them thinking
- The point is to help them empathize with the Martins family
- We'll see how they responded next
-->

# Their Choice: Act in Faith

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

**What They Did:**

After learning about the priesthood restriction, the Martins family **chose to act in faith**.

They were soon baptized and served faithfully in the Church for many years.

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-center">

<div class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800">
"We had found the truth, and nothing would stop us from living it."
</div>

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
— Elder Helvécio Martins
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Rather than focusing on what they didn't know, they focused on what they DID know
- They knew the gospel was true through the Holy Ghost
- They chose to act in faith despite not understanding everything
- This is the key principle: acting in faith during uncertainty
- They were baptized and became faithful members

# Years of Faithful Service

<div class="space-y-4">

## 1975: São Paulo Temple Announced

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

In 1975, the Church announced that a temple would be built in São Paulo, Brazil.

**Their Response:**

"Although we didn't expect to enter it, we worked for the construction of the temple just like other members. It was the house of the Lord, after all."

- Sister Martins sold her jewelry to help with fund-raising
- Brother Martins served on the publicity committee

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Three years after their baptism, a temple was announced
- They didn't expect to enter it because of the priesthood restriction
- But they STILL worked to help build it!
- This shows incredible faith and love for the Lord
- They gave sacrificially even though they couldn't receive the blessings yet
- Ask: What does this teach us about faith?

# Background Context

<div class="space-y-3">

## What Was the Policy?

<div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg text-sm">

From the introduction to [Official Declaration 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng):

"Early in its history, Church leaders stopped conferring the priesthood on Black males of African descent. Church records offer no clear insights into the origins of this practice."

</div>

## Important Truths

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 text-sm">

<div class="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

**From the Start:**

[2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng) teaches that God invites "all to come unto him... black and white, bond and free, male and female."

</div>

<div class="p-3 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

**Church Position:**

We do not know why this restriction was in place. We should not speculate about the reasons.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- The introduction to OD 2 says "Church records offer no clear insights into the origins"
- This is the official position of the Church
- We don't know why it was in place
- But we do know God loves all His children equally
- 2 Nephi 26:33 has always been clear that all are invited to come unto Christ
- From the beginning, Church leaders prayed for the day when all could hold the priesthood

# Seeking the Lord's Guidance

<div class="space-y-4">

## President Spencer W. Kimball

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-base">

<div class="italic">

"Day after day I went alone and with great solemnity and seriousness in the upper rooms of the temple, and there I offered my soul and offered my efforts to go forward with the program. I wanted to do what he wanted. I talked about it to him and said, 'Lord, I want only what is right... We want only the thing that thou dost want, and we want it when you want it and not until.'"

</div>

<div class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-3">
— President Spencer W. Kimball

<div class="p-8 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-xl">

# The Martins Family's Joy

<div class="space-y-4">

<div class="p-6 bg-yellow-50 rounded-lg">

After learning about the revelation, Helvécio recalled:

<div class="text-lg italic mt-3">

"I could not contain my emotions. Rudá and I went into our bedroom, knelt down, and prayed. We wept as we thanked our Father in Heaven for an event we had only dreamed about. The day had actually arrived, and in _our_ mortal lives."

</div>

</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

The Martins family was sealed in the São Paulo Temple

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

</div>

</div>

- Helvécio eventually became a General Authority

# The Key Principle

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-100 to-purple-100 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">
