# Imagine...

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">
A Single Grain of Sand
</div>

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">
How many grains of sand do you think are on a beach?

How about in the entire world?
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Start with this thought experiment to prepare their minds
- Scientists estimate there are roughly 7.5 quintillion grains of sand on Earth
- That's 7,500,000,000,000,000,000 grains
- This helps students grasp the scale of what Moses is about to see
- We'll use this comparison in the next slides

# Moses Sees God's Creations

## Moses 1:27–29

<div class="space-y-6">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg text-xl">

**Key Phrase:**

"Worlds without number have I created"

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg text-xl">

**The Comparison:**

Like the sand upon the seashore

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Read Moses 1:27-29 together as a class
- Moses sees ALL of God's creations in a vision
- "Worlds without number" - countless planets, solar systems, galaxies
- God compares His creations to grains of sand on the seashore
- This is an almost incomprehensible number
- The universe is VAST beyond our understanding
- NASA estimates there are at least 100 billion galaxies
- Each galaxy contains billions of stars and planets
- Ask: What stands out to you from these verses?
-->

# The Scale of Creation

::left::

## Our Universe

<div class="space-y-3 text-sm">

- 🌍 **Earth** - Our home planet
- ☀️ **Solar System** - 8 planets orbiting our sun
- 🌌 **Milky Way Galaxy** - 100-400 billion stars
- 🌠 **Observable Universe** - 100+ billion galaxies

</div>

::right::

## God's Creations

<div class="p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

### Moses 1:35

"For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man"

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Help students grasp the immense scale
- Our solar system is tiny compared to our galaxy
- Our galaxy is tiny compared to the universe
- And God has created "worlds without number"
- This includes worlds that existed in the past
- Worlds that exist now
- Worlds we cannot even count or comprehend
- This shows God's infinite power and creative ability

# Moses's Question

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">
"Why?"
</div>

<div class="text-2xl text-gray-700">
Moses 1:30

"Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so"
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- After seeing all these countless worlds, Moses asks "Why?"
- Why did God create all of this?
- What's the purpose?
- This is one of the most fundamental questions humans ask
- Why does anything exist?
- Moses was bold enough to ask God directly
- And God answers him!
- The answer is in verse 39 - one of the most important verses in scripture
-->

# God's Answer

<div class="text-center space-y-4">

## The Most Important Verse

<div class="text-xl text-gray-700">
Moses 1:39
</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- This is the climax of the lesson
- God's answer to Moses's question
- This verse explains the entire purpose of creation
- It's a Doctrinal Mastery passage - students should memorize it
- Let's read it together carefully

# Moses 1:39

<div class="space-y-8 max-w-5xl mx-auto">

<div class="p-12 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-100 to-purple-100 rounded-xl">

<div class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-8 leading-tight">
"For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Read this verse slowly and with emphasis
- This is God's PURPOSE for everything He does
- ALL of creation - the universe, planets, stars, Earth - exists for ONE reason
- To help God's children gain immortality and eternal life
- This verse should change how we see everything
- We are not insignificant specs in a vast universe
- We are the REASON for the universe!
- President Uchtdorf said: "The vast expanse of eternity...is all built for the benefit of ordinary mortals like you and me"
- Let that sink in for a moment

# Understanding the Key Words

<div class="space-y-4">

## Two Important Terms

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<div class="p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

### 💫 Immortality

**Definition:**

To live forever as a resurrected being

**How:**

Through Jesus Christ's Atonement - free gift to ALL

</div>

<div class="p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

### ✨ Eternal Life

**Definition:**

To live in God's presence forever as families, becoming like Him

**How:**

Through faith, repentance, covenants, and enduring to the end

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Presenter Notes:
- Make sure students understand these two terms clearly
- IMMORTALITY = living forever (everyone receives this through Christ's resurrection)
- ETERNAL LIFE = exaltation, living with God as families, becoming like Him
- Immortality is a free gift through the Atonement
- Eternal life requires our choices and covenants
- Both are part of God's work and glory
- God wants BOTH for all His children
- He has provided the way through Jesus Christ

Presenter Notes:
- This is a powerful perspective shift
